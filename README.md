Final project for my MSc Dissertation: Comparing the Accuracy of Encoder-only vs. Decoder-only Transformers in Video Game Review Semantic Classification

My dissertation focused on fine-tuning two prominent LLMs, BERT and GPT, for the task of semantic classification of video game reviews.
Utilising the Hugging Face Transformers library, I adapted these models to classify reviews based on sentiment and thematic content. 
This project demonstrated my proficiency in natural language processing, model fine-tuning, and working with advanced machine learning frameworks.

Final fine-tuned models are too large to upload, Model_Generator showcases how they were created.
Uncleaned dataset was also too large to be uploaded but can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harisyafie/baldurs-gate-3-steam-reviews
