CON: maybe its me, but the constant refocusing the view is a slight pain, so i do wish there were some camera control options were available.

I know the game is all about luck but when you do the roll chances and get multiple 5 and below on a 20 sided dice it makes you want to uninstall the game as you get cuck out of many story lines and have to either start over again or load back from a previous save and hope your last save isn't to far back.

Not even out of act 1 (of 3 I think), and this game is already larger and more engaging and interesting than a lot of other titles. Played it in EA for all of the content available at the time and loved it then. Playing it now at launch and it's only majorly improved.

The devs deserve so much credit for this game and their approach to making it!

"The game is just fun, pure and simple. It brings a new twist to D&D 5e that is unique and fine-tuned for the game it is. Genuinely could not recommend it enough for people on the fence or D&D fans.",1
Its a great game and lods of fun playing with friends,1
"this game is incredible everything from gameplay, visuals, stability, characters, voice acting, choices and impact on the world around you, even soundtrack are so good.  Larian has delivered a gameplay experience i havent seen since Skyrim or Dragon Age: Origins.  Complete game on release with no microtransactions :')",1
"Too buggy for an Alpha version, but doesnt feel unfinished. Just Unpolished. 

EVERY. SINGLE. NPC. has voiced dialogue and cutscenes and the game throughs you right into the combat and doesnt insult you by force feeding you textboxes every 2 nanoseconds as if youre some ADHD kid off their meds like in 99% of japanese games. 


Brb stuck at owlbear as the game gets stuck in a black screen for no reason while the game is literally still running while this god damn letterbox is blocking my screen. 

Also Yeeti",0
"This is in early access currently, so take what I say with a grain of salt as the game is subject to change.... but boy am I loving it! I am completely new to the Baldur's Gate franchise, but this was a hidden gem I am happy to have found. If you like Dungeons and Dragons but stuck in Isolation during Covid-19 this is a perfect game for you... at least, that is what I think. I would highly recommend it! Have a good one guys!",1
"I love it when I accidentally make a companion sad by misclicking, trying to reload to not hurt their feelings, and realizing that my last save was 2 hours ago.

11/10 would re-do again",1
"As a lifelong player of D&D, this is what everyone wishes their campaigns could be. Fantastic story, characters, and mechanics with just the right amount of jank to keep it interesting.",1
Add Neko Arc,1
"The game has been a fun experience with friends, definitely not a game I would recommend solo as (minor spoilers) the party member stories are somewhat interesting but all feel very samey as ALL of them but the druids have some god or giant catastrophic foe to deal with, and while interesting it falls off hard in act 3 with the sheer amount of useless NPC's with nothing to say that only exist to chunk performance, seemingly alot of cut content, otherwise very uninteresting encounters and very rushed feeling",0
"This is my new standard for RPG's. The amount of ways you can approach ANY situation in this game is actually astounding. I have been so taken away by this game so far, and i can't wait to see what else it has left in store. This game is like no other, glad to see a new standard set in the world of gaming.",1
game is great. I really dont like that I spent 8 hours 2 days before the full release on a character thinking that i'd be able to continue playing with that character. but that's honestly my only complaint. highly recommend,1
"Do you hate having free time? Do you like Dungeons and Dragons? Do you like having a bunch of hot psychopaths flirting with you nonstop every time you want to lay down for bed? Well, this is the game for you.",1
it's D&D,1
"I'm nearing the end of the 1st act, trying to do *everything* I can before I move on. Everything about this game has been great so far. The characters, the story, the voice acting, the mechanics, controls, etc. If you only have money to get 1 game for the next few months I'd recommend picking this up.",1
Literally so fun,1
"It's a pretty good representation of DnD online. Larian has done an excellent job making the game, and I'm quite pleased to play it.",1
"Can't stop playing, my sleep schedule has been fucked up and reversed, and I still want to start a new playthrough. The value for hundreds of hours of quality content is worth it.",1
"This game is so absurdly satisfying. I'm about 6 and a half hours into my furthest character's adventure (2 hours of character creation, of course) and already happily squirm with the decisions that are to be made. It's still very early into the game and I can't wait to jump into another play-through, thinking how radically different my choices might be. I do worry how painstaking some future decisions could be, but however difficult, the outcomes are usually remarkable. Things below, I had to share:

The only game where a bear and a vampire walk into a bar and instead of it being a setup for it joke it ends up being a gay harem. 10/10.,1
"You can check my hours played and see I really like this game... But, it still feels like its early access. Act 1 is really polished, though it still has quite a few bugs in it despite that. Repeating dialogue/event cut scenes, broken quests that can't b e completed, etc. Act 2 is similar though with a bit more confusing narrative/navigation. The point of no return that advances the main quest feels really weird. And then you get to Act 3, where it really just breaks over and over again. Tons of quests not ",0

Undeniably the greatest game of all time,1
One of the best Role Playing games out there. I've never gotten a real D&D feel quite like this game offers.,1

"if you like dnd, you should love this",1
"I was recommended this game by MANY friends and I am so happy their recommendations led me to this absolute gem of a game. I've never played a game like this before, nor am I too familiar with DnD, but needless to say after experiencing Baulder's Gate 3 I feel like I've been really missing out!

The dialogue is wonderfully written and I've thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the plethora of npc's available. Everyone feels so alive and real and it truly feels as though I'm navigating this strange world with ",1
"- Has local and online multiplayer coop
- Game is fully voiced
- Good semi turn based combat
- Good replayable story from the perspectives of the different origin characters
- Memorable characters
- Good interpretation of the dnd 5e rule set with implementation of spells and abilities to last until long rest. 

Maybe in the future we'll get features from 'Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything' and a higher level cap story but until then we've got mods.",1

" Baldur's Gate 3 is a game of the year 
as good as Baldurs Gate 2
very well written story and well made game. 

looking forward to DLC or more added stuff over time. 
",1
Absolutely love it~ from character creation to gameplay and story 10/10,1
"Great game! Been playing on Steam Deck, and everything is working great. Not the same stunning graphics as PC, but that's to be expected. I'm having a fantastic time exploring and fighting! 10/10",1
"For the moment i can't recommend to buy the game, which is in ealry access for about one more year by the way.

Firstly, if you get performance issues after the introduction chapter, despite having at least the minimum recommanded config for your pc, i highly recommand to ask for a refund. At the moment nothing prooves that the developpers are going to make an optimisation patch anytime soon, they didn't speak about it while a lot of players are affected by huge fps drop even with very recent config.

I made a half orc bard that looked permanently depressed but after a few rounds with his camp friends and some casual brutal murdering he still looked permanently depressed but now also covered in tomato sauce. 10/10,1
"Unfortunately after finishing up the game I can say that Act 3 ruins what would be perfection. And its in every aspect too which makes it all the more infuriating. 
***SPOILERS********
Story:
-No compelling end with any companion, particularly love interests
-No ending cinematic going over past decisions or future character choices
-Overall rushed ending
-Disappointing final companion reveal (due to lack of time with character as I picked them up within 4 hrs of finishing the story)

Gameplay:
-As a avid DM",0
"People really disliked when famous RPG Mass Effect 3 offered three differently colored endings with nothing very distinct about them or anything substantial to leave with, save for a few seconds of cutscene. Larian saw that, and did a very cool thing where they [spoiler]offered two[/spoiler]. If you're lucky, you might even get to see parts of one of those if it doesn't bug itself into nonexistence, because the other one sure as hell doesnt have anything to show you beyond [spoiler]sitting on a chair[/spoil",0
I played this game with 48fps with any setting :))),1
"""best crpg adaptation of D&D"" Yeah, if your DM is a complete jerk who loves to railroad you into combat constantly. Despite having strong options for avoiding fights, it's almost always preferable to choose combat so you have enough experience to survive the mandatory fights, which are typically against very strong enemies. Maybe it's different on the easiest difficulty, but ""balanced"" might as well be ""I hope you like being a murder hobo."" Save early, save often, maybe wait for a sale.",0
Amazing. In Astarion we trust.,1

Best game of 2023 so far!,1
"DO NOT BUY!!!!! Game is just a cash grab, using the name of a highly anticipated sequel to Baldur's Gate: Shadow of Amn...NOT Divinity or dragon age....I don't know how or why people think this is supposed to be like either of those games.

Game looks fantastic, but combat, dialogue, ui, movement....everything else is slow/uninspired. 

Oh and it has tons of texture problems for cut-scenes/character interactions, crashes, weird multiplayer bugs,   combat bugs ETC!

Game should have been called anything else",0

"It's pretty... Thats about as much as I can say thats good.  The DnD5e system is bland, lacks depth, basically it allows you to be anything with out the consequences of your choice. To explain, it use to be a fighter couldn't cast spell, now EVERY class can! I know there were specialized subclasses before but this system removes the cause and effect ofchoice, making choice meaningless. Wanna be a wizard and wear plate?

You can pick up a goblin to strike another goblin. 10/10 would yeet them off the cliff again.,1
"1.  It's painfully obvious that this is NOT a new Baldur's Gate. It's Divinity: Original Sin 3 with licensing to use D&D assets. As D:OS3, it is a HUGE step above the first two D:OS games (which are quite tedious), but it is NOT a BG experience. 

2.  Nudity: what the *%$@ is wrong with these euro-devs? I WANT TO PLAY AN RPG, not browse the internet for porn. if you think this is a harmless game for your child, i can guarantee you that they have armor hidden and nudity showing so that they can get all the e",0

This Game is a very Perfect DnD campaign like game and all the character's and environments are so one point and we don't need to buy fucken DLC for good content take note developers if you need to lock some of the game behind a paywall then don't release the game as all your doing is padding your pockets and how can we trust that the dlc is going to add or subtract from the players experience all in all I give this game a 10/10,1
LITTTTT,1
Great game. Definitely worth it.,1
Never have played D&D before this experience. What an incredible game. I cannot overstate how great they did and how replayable the game is. Please buy to support Larian and change the gaming industry.,1
"Even if it's still buggy in early access, the game feels complete and is fun overall. If you like DnD5e, you will probably enjoy that game even more. The gameplay is really similar. 


Things I really don't like that I hope they will fix before the release:

"Why didn't these ""characters"" just remove themselves from the dullest CRPG in the history of CRPGs? Seriously each quest following Tav and his/her pals from the Forgotten Realms as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the gloomy imagery, the game's only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of visual effects, all to make magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.

Larian Studio delivers another masterpiece.,1
"An action packed story paired with the highest quality of companions, Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best story driven RPGs I've played. If you liked or had ever seen anything about Larian Studios Divinity series then the familiar controls and character progression system will make you feel right at home. Truly this is one of those kinda games that only come out once in a blue moon.",1
Sexed a demon in hell. 10/10,1

Love the series. Incredibly disappointed with this quality. So many bugs. I'd rank it up there with Cyberpunk 2077... I'd estimate 6 hrs of my 15 hrs played was wasted trying to work around bugs and backing up saves because something glitched. Give me back my money.,0

"Pretty good RPG, though it has a lot of problems, mostly bugs.

Game is VERY buggy, I'd say at least a third of the major quests in Act 1 bugged out and couldn't be completed. Often times the game would say to go to a spot and talk to an NPC, only for that NPC to just be gone, and on your next long rest the game would say ""whoopsie, they're dead, not sure how, oh well.""

No real CONs for now except one, the game is built on D&D 5e system, which, imo, is not suited for digital and should stay on tabletop. Ability scores, classes, dice, etc. Makes the game unexpectedly (since I love D&D) fiddly, awkward or unexciting. These annoyances only",1

I have always liked the idea of D&D, but being anti-social, it was never for me. This game does an amazing job of finally bringing the true D&D experience to a solo computer game. I don't think I've ever been as invested in a game before, to the point where i nearly cried at the end!

"In the end, this was another Larian game that I didn't finish because I lost interest. Minsk and Jehiera were the only two companions really worth having, and they came way to late to enjoy. This game could have been so much more, but they spent their initial focus on their LBGT and ""Be evil"" agenda instead of making a suitable engine for the genre, which ultimately sucked up all their development time in trying to make an inferior rule-set work.

This game is in no way a spiritual successor to the original",0

I'm heartbroken. i9-10900KF, RTX 3080, NVMe, but I can't get my characters to cross a bridge because they stop every 1 ft for several minutes while the game loads and unloads things. I was really enjoying the game. I've reinstalled, repaired, lowered the settings to absolute minimum, clearing caches, every guide out there to fix, I followed, no success.",0

First rpg style game and I loved it,1

Wonderful game with loads of content,1
Looks and sounds great.  Larian did a ton of work here.  The problem I had with it as the turn based combat.  I've always hated turn based combat.  Every few years I try it and hope I can stand it.  It didn't work this time.  Sorry Larian.  Thanks for the rebate.,0
An ingenious mix between old tradition RPG and modern game design. Thank Larian.,1
"Was worried about how this game would be with the D&D aspect added as i loved the old Baldur's Gate so much.

After 70 hours nearly 3 full playthroughs i can happily say i love it. I was so surprised by how easy it was to play and yeah there were many glitches and bugs but i knew i was in for that when it was early access.

Yep. It's good,1

"Simply put, one of the best rpg games i'v played in a long time. Whether or not your playing by yourself, or a full party, it has the detail and charm to keep you and your friends occupied for many many hours. The only real criticism I might have of the game, is that for those who havn't played other Larian games before, or games like this in general, there are a lot of hotkeys that are incredibly useful that the game doesn't really tell you, which you'd have to look up.",1
"It really feels like people are holding this thing up on a pedestal when it doesn't deserve it: it's just DOS2 again but somehow just as finicky in its gameplay (oh boy, I sure do love at least 3 ground puddle AOEs in every fight where every single enemy spams ranged attacks and poison).

The balance is lacking, the variety compared to what is available in 5e is lacking, the Co-op experience leaves quite a bit to be desired in my opinion. Could this game be great? Sure, there's a lot that is charming about it too, but maybe save your money for now.",0
"Having a good time, but the systems are too frustrating, and not a lot of instructions are offered to get around them.

The beginning is annoying. Enemies are overpowered, whichever direction you go, the resting system means you get into fights without any skills available, when you are eventually one-shoted since all your skills are timed out and there is almost no way to improve your gear or your character, you lose about an hour's worth of play because there is no autosave function.

Balancing can be very frustrating because unlike a DnD session encounters don't scale so until you are level 4 party wise, trying to do sidequests to level up for the big fight can either result in easy fights with good rewards or you getting blases by 8 CR4 monsters that can roll your entire party in a single turn.

I've enjoyed this game so much, i'm going to play as a spell caster next

"As a curmudgeonly, old school gamer. I went into Baldur's Gate 3 with my arms crossed defiantly, determined to hate how my beloved Baldur's Gate series had been ruined by a bunch of young, upstart game developers. I scowled when I created my characters, ""What is this 5th edition nonsense? Back in my day we played 2nd edition and we liked it! Where's my THAC0? Why does armor raise my armor class instead of lower it?  Why can any race be any class?!? Drow Paladin? Gnome Barbarian? Such nonsense! And where the",1

"Summary:
Bruh this game is gonna be baller af. It's DA Origins meets DND. Classic turn-based combat with better graphics and giga story-telling. The best part is the character customization options from background/story to combat styles, the sexy af hair styles, and the gods we pray to when we hit those nat 1s.

First of all, combat is turn-based. Yeah I know DnD is turn-based, but this has a massive impact on the world and the gameplay.",0
Super fun and challenging.,1
LOOOOOOVE IT,1
A good RPG but they took zero time on technical considerations. I wish there was a more neutral position. The game is so large it can break your PC if you're not watching how much it downloads and starts saving. It also has large updates. Usually all good things but not when they optimize absolutely nothing. Consider making room of around 200-250gb's or expect the game to break your machine eventually. Its an absolute hog and will demand sole consideration out of your computers drive.,0

Some of the changes make sense for the purposes of being rules-as-fun for a video game, but the super closeness is making me forget what's a BG3 rule and what's a 5e rule. This goes extra for character creation being restricted to ""PHB content"".

"TLDR: Early Access- but decent quality

The game feels above most EA titles, and feels like a Larian game. The inclusion of D&D 5E combat rules makes combat feel terribly slow in multiplayer, but speeds up as the game progresses some. 

Vulcan implementation leaves a LOT to be desired, and framerate and stability are universally improved in DX11 as of 10/7/2020. 

Hoping they are able to improve this as it goes on, perhaps adding some sort of ""miss correction"" like Pillars of Eternity does for the low level",1

"It's turn based combat, but doesn't say that anywhere on the store page which makes it feel bait and switch.
The movement and camera system is horrible. The cut-scenes are needlessly creepy, and there should be a warning for them.

"Update for Full Release (After 260h total Gametime):
It finally happened the Masterpiece in the making has finally dropped and basically warped an entire week for me, one could say I was in the grasps of the Absolute. The Story telling did not let up its strong from Start to finish, and it’s very interesting how certain early Act 1 decisions play out.

Larion did a great job with Baldur's Gate 3. I waited to purchase the game after full release due to my disappointment in early access games in the past.

Sorry, maybe my standards have not lowered over the years along with everyone else's, but the level of storywriting and character development does not even come close to that of Bioware games of 2000's and early 2010's, which this is supposed to play off of.

DnD is a social game, meaning the greatest joys of it come from the friends you play it with and most of it is make or break depending on your game master (who is a human and not system controlled).

This game... is a mess.  It's DnD but not.  Its combat is horribly mundane due to not being able to diversify yo",0
RPGs take a lot of hard work compared to most games to make when I think about it. All the small cut scenes and events must be handcrafted and then only make up for a small amount of the player's experience. While most games are loops of the same thing like a multiplayer game has matches or a rogue like has random levels. To these games you can add a new weapon and it will be considered a huge update. But not this one. They really went all out adding more and more little secrets and details it is amazing.,1

The initial character customisation can seem daunting at first if you want to build your own character, but I think it's worth it! There are easy prefab options but building your own is a lot of fun and can be changed later in the game.

If you are a fan of actually playing Dungeons and Dragons. This is as close as you can get without actually playing a regular session.

Yes, the game is very good and has many options and is pretty much how we imagined role playing games as a child, full of opportunity and possibilities.

"The one thing that caught me most about this game is it's writing and character interactions. Compared to a game that I thought would've been a decent competitor, Starfield, it went beyond what I would've expected from that game.

Interacting with people in this game felt more genuine and authentic due in no small part from the voice acting and whoever made sure to give all of their characters such amazing facial expressions.

When I played Starfield, when it released, it was such a noticeable downgrade tha",1

"EDIT: I have just started playing this game now that it is officially out to see if the problems in this review were addressed. So far, my experience has been very similar to that of my Early Access playtime: an unpolished gem, tarnished in just enough areas to cause frustration but not enough to stop the shine. If this quality continues throughout the game, then I am happy to say that the game has exceeded expectations.

PRE-FINAL EDIT: I was right. The game becomes increasingly linear as you progress with",0
"This game is still riddled with bugs. Not the kind that mess with gameplay, the kind that swallows save files and destroys hours of progress, and the kind that crash the game repeatedly, over and over. Patch #4 seems to have made it worse somehow.",0

"I was new to the Baldurs Gate Franchise , but already knew Larian were excellent from Divinity OG Sin 2,
but this. this game is even more amazing. Graphics are awesome, Dialogues are well written and interesting, Story is good, and you are very free in what to do and how to do it.  I´ve not seen a game that does the translation of the Dnd5e Rules better. This game has a soul and you can really feel how much work and passion was involved in making it.
Thank you Larian for the over 100 hours of fun & exciteme",1
"It was more fun than not throughout but in the end, there isn't much there. Maybe get it on sale.
If I knew this was it, I would have passed, but I got early access, foolishly expecting more.

No custom party, no city of Baldur's Gate and the end sucks. I've been less disappointed by early access games that never released.",0
"Short answer is that this is a worse version of Divinity Original Sin 2.

Narration is clearly very good but the substance of the dialogue is very poor and when you look at other areas of the game you can clearly see the writing of the game is a big step down from what we have been used to previously. Much of the dialogue is either mundane or has been written for a teenage audience slapped with an 18+ tag. It seems clear they have no intention of making the dialogue better as everything is already voiced.

I grew up with video games and I thought with my old age I was just becoming more and more jaded with video games. I felt like I couldn't connect or have fun with any video games anymore in the last couple of years.

It felt like there was so much care and love poured into this game and made me realize I do truly still love videos games. ,1

"If you've ever played BG3 (Baldur's Gate 3 that is) you will know that it is the best one to one adaptation of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition into a video game.

Further, the writing in this game is impeccable, and each story line makes sense, no matter which direction you chose to go in. This game may go down",1

- I've had Lae'zel's hotbars disappear at least once a day, and the only way to fix it is to quicksave and reload.

... but the more I played the more I had to realize that the game is just a tactical turn based fighting simulator with shallow roleplay and extremely slow story progression.

"Massive massive disappointment. This game is a heavy downgrade compared to Divinity in every aspect and littered with bugs.

Disclaimer: This is still an okay game. But the level of hype is totally out of place.

The issues why i'm saying this:
- No level up on your character. You can't assign skill attributre and talent points at every level up like in every RPG
- No crafting. Remember in Divinity where every seamingly nonsense item ",0

The game is still early access so I'm hoping this changes. But for a game based on 5e rules having skill checks critical fail or critical success is a deal breaker for me. I absolutely hate that rule and the fact that rules as written for 5e doesn't have it makes me not want to play this game. Other than that it's not too buggy for early access and the story is interesting so far. Just a terrible choice for this one rule IMO.,0

"If you enjoyed Divinity original sin 1 or 2, this game is built off of the foundation of those games, with some more D&D mechanics thrown into the mix. This game is great for both existing fans of this genre and new players looking for a very in-depth and interesting RPG. The game is still in Early Access so be prepared for some bugs and graphical issues, I havent hit any game breaking bugs yet and the bugs ive seen have mostly led to more comedic effect.",1

"The game is in a very bad and bland state. I will try to summarize the problems in a CONS and PROS type of way:
CONS:
-No Seasonal Mechanics
-No Always Online
-No Paid Microtransactions
-No Problems Managing Inventory And Stash Space
-No Open World MMO Elements
-Not Enough Women As Main Characters
-Not Enough Inclusivity
-Not Enough Vitriol On The Forums
-Not Enough False Promises
-Not Enough LGBTQ+ Characters
-No Chase Items
-No Item Random Affixes
-No Repeatable Content Like NMD
-No Horse In The Game

It's a great game but personally bugs have killed it for me. I've replayed so much content idek if i want to finish at this point :( I play on both my desktop and steam deck so maybe some files got messed up in the cross save but I started getting crazy texture pops and quest errors impeding my progress mostly in Act 3 so far.,0
"I was really excited about this game, and bought the early access version many years ago. It was certainly fun the first time through, but I couldn't get in to the re-running the same content every single time an update was published.

Now, what *really* excites me is how cloud syncing of saved games doesn't work well - despite multiple years of early access - and when it fails, the workaround is to erase your data - including saved games - and start over.",0
"As someone who is new to the genre would not recommend this game. Some weird bugs that made the game hard (force reloads or just basic rests not working), lot of stuff going on, lack of explanation / onboarding into the game. Playing with multiple people is very annoying, missing most of the info and random stuff happening. I get into an area and someone tells me to leave, I wasn't even there. Dialogs are tedious long and boring. Trying things that don't work (I thought that was a plus of the game) and weir",0

Not quite NWN, but close enough. It will likely be patched up to that level as time goes on.",1
great game for dnd lovers,1
"8/10. 

There are still bugs, crashes, and unpolished technical edges. Unfortunately, there are also issues with inconsistent adaptation of 5e's ruleset in a way that seems arbitrary and limiting. I understand that the entire ruleset cannot be meaningfully adapted, but my largest issues are the seemingly limiting divisions of actions and BAs in the action economy. 

The positive far outweigh the negatives in this experience. There are many QOL additions that one can tell that the design of the game included",1
"Don't believe the hype. This game does some things extremely well in Act-1, enough to make me forgive the insane amount of game breaking bugs and other issues I encountered. Everything completely unravels by Act-3 revealing a deeply flawed and obviously incomplete game that will leave you disappointed.

Each combat encounter feels hand crafted with multiple approaches and tactical options. It really delivers on the potential in DnD mechanics in a way that many DMs fail",0

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Oct 2022:

As of October I have, thanks to a friend, been able to get an updated machine that can play the game again. With my new hardware I intend to test the game more. It was disappointing that I was not able to play the game for so long but understand that the progression of technology can't be put on hold forever for people like myself who can't afford new computers.

I'm excited to get back into seeing what's been done with the updates since Patch 6.


EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Oct 2021",1
TURN BASED GAME... VERY VERY SAD . THE END,0
"[h1] Do I recommend Baldur's Gate 3? [/h1]

Well earlier I met two kids. One a girl one a boy, who were running a little shop that turned out to be not so genuine. After the boy [i] Who did all the dealings in the shop [/i] tried to scam me with some magical ring of luck. I decided to humor him and look at his [i] REAL [/i] wares. The people were falling on tough times and I felt sympathy for the kids. When I did so I felt a brush against my back. I turned to find the girl attempting to steal from me while ",1
Do I really need to explain? It's the truest RPG we've had  in the last decade.,1
there's so much stuff!,1
First turn based game i've played.  I enjoy and kinda enamored with all the options.  Dice rolls are the thorn in my side lol.,1
Having to relearn how to have actual fun in a game has been a great experience. The absolute freedom of choice and the obvious level of care they put into the game make it well worth the price. Buying this game also shows AAA studios that making a good game rather than one based on psychological manipulation filled with microtransactions is perfectly viable and definitely profitable.,1
this game is for you,1
As not a fun of turn-based RPG's this game still manages to win me over with its immense customisation and expansive story routes and possibilities!,1
Sweeet,1
"So far the game is good with one major exception. The party system is horrid. If someone disconnects or is joining a game then you have to long rest which activates cinematics and many other features which delay the joining process or interupt character creation. The characters of your friends cannot be swapped or told to go to camp. We have sat for hours on end thus far resting and re-resting just to try to get people in. The game aside from this, is so far outstanding. If you are playing solo it is fun. H",1

I will play BBG3 until I either die or until this game in longer supported in 6 years. I love its difficult but addicting! I think E. Gary Gygax would too ! If anyone at Larian Studios reads this thank you for your par excellence game !  Enjoys this game friends and 10/10. Solid.",1

Typically I could care less about them, but after hearing what people had to say about cyberpunk I could not believe BG3 had such a positive reviews. First I am not a avid supporter of cyberpunk, but they were scrutinized for visual and game breaking bugs. I have encountered at least 1-2 visual bugs per hour for every hour i played... multiplayer & singplayer. For game play where is my magic dam",0

Honestly one of the best games out there. I was already into DnD and this just brings everything together so well. One of the best games I've ever played and one of the only single player games that has really just sucked me in. I would highly recommend.,1
"Very clunky. Needs a TON of polish. Desperate studio pre-selling vaporware years before they have a product because they have zero revenue and apparently no investors. This game literally prompted me to write several Senators and Congressman asking for legislation to protect consumers, mainly kids with mommy's credit card, from this kind of bait and switch  cash grab fraud. I've learned one thing for sure though, DON'T EVER PRE-ORDER or BUY ""EARLY RELEASE"" ANYTHING these days. We are living the age of cash ",0

Fair price, amazing story and actors and high replay value, I alread plan my next playthroughs. There are occasional crashes, so don't forget to quicksave regularly, but even with that it's 110% worth it. Thank you so much Larian and everyone that worked on this masterpiece!

Edit: With new updates, I had no more crashes :)",1
This game is not fun,1
"Very high quality game for its genre, but I don't think it's an accessible ambassador to the genre. It's missing some qol that makes combat feel extremely slow, even for a turned based game. The character creation is amazing, but do you see yourself slugging through these quests more than once?https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/#

This game is amazing. It took a while for me to update my computer for the game to run well but it's wonderful! The story line is in depth and really scratches the itch for Dungeons and Dragons players who can't play at the moment. Every choice influences the story. It's by far the best game I've played in a very long time!,1
"I bought into the early access a long time ago when this game was unplayable and did not endorse it in that state. Now way too many years later with the full launch I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the previous baldur's gates, neverwinter nights, or any of Larian's other games. it's not a perfect game by any stretch, there are some bugs left, most of the remaining ones are more comical than game breaking though, and the camera leaves a lot to be desired when exploring, but seems to wor",1

"Multiplayer between Mac and PC doesn't work, because Early Access builds have a different version number than PC's full release build.

So what you see in the FAQ/Support that multiplayer between platforms works is not true and if you run on a Mac you should avoid buying the game until it fully releases for Mac. I paid full price but can't play with friends (it was my biggest reason to buy the game), support doesn't really respond aside from generic useless messages, and the Mac release date is still unknow",0
"Larian has done a lot of work.  They have made what could be an amazing game.  This is not really a D&D game though.  It is based, mainly, on 5th Edition.  While this game has been being made though, the company that releases D&D rule sets has already made plans to move on to a new version of D&D and Larian has run into issues making it work as it should in a video game, so it has been modified.  I think Larian is doing the best that they can here.  I really do.  I would bet most of my money on the communit",0
I am currently not satisfied with the direction they appear to be taking with the game. I understand that the DnD ruleset can not be recreated perfectly in a video game however after playing Solasta it is clear that Larian could be doing a far better job.

While the falling prone thing could have something to do with the AI the way that the game handles sneak attack at the mome,1

Let's start with the good. The voice acting and the facial character animations are excellent.

You start in a random, rocky foresty area. Just like every other Larian game. The degree of creative bankruptcy on display is really quite atrocious for a game name Baldur's Gate 3.

It's a great game for DnD fans I'm sure, and the story and world and ambiance so far seem amazing. In fact, I'd go as far as giving it a really high score on most metrics.

Regrettably, the D&D aspect makes it virtually unplayable to me. Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss me with this stupid combat style. If a mod ever emerges that ",0

"The good:
-Best RPG in the market as of right now.
-Graphics are gorgeous.
-Writing/Dialogue is excellent and interesting.
-Characters have depth.
-Combat is pretty fun, specially CO-OP (It's a different type of TBC, you can both attack at the same time!)
-The game world feels alive, with stuff to do at every corner. I love it.
-Many different hidden things scattered through the game.

The bad:
-Minimal woke stuff.

"Extremely happy after a very cursory play session to see how some basic mechanics work.  Larian has definitely done its homework on the 5E system. I have read some complaints about the turn-based combat but that is D&D - turn-based combat. Even the original Baldur's Gate games you often were pausing anyway to issue orders. In any event, I am really happy to see that Larian is working hard to try and capture the D&D experience - even to the point of adding a die roll for certain actions and having the player",1

It's as good as you've heard.,1
The game is a great adaptation of the 5th edition D&D rules.  Very good story and rich experiences that can change every play through.  Feels as good to play as BG2 did many years ago. :),1

Unpopular opinion. Game is over rated. Combat is lacking. Strategy is lacking. Balancing of classes is lacking. Play the classes the devs like or suffer from developer neglect. Just the combat. Everything else is S+ in comparison to what we get from games these days. My thumbs down is my opinion. Divinity is better. If I could go back in time and stop this purchase I would.

This game is good, great even, but it's basically DOS2, with some obvious Dragon Age Origins/Inquision influence using D&D 5e mechanics and the Forgotten Realms setting.

It starts out great, and the writing, voice acting, world building is all amazing

But combat is a huge part of this game and it is so bad. It is boring, slow, and way too RNG based. It requires rests which interfere with how the story should feel like progressing. I don't want to sleep after two or three fights just to use some spells. I shouldn't say 'oh yet another ambush. time to reload an earlier save'. There are ways to overcome this ofc but those methods make the game",0

The first couple of hours of gameplay is a little bit too linear and the dialogue isn't overly great, but later on it feels a bit more fluid and enjoyable.

On a personal side, I don't like the DnD 5 ruleset on which this game is based ; but I can live with it.

However, honestly, the end game (at the time where you definitively leave the city) sucks really big time, especially if you like RP and are attached to your character and your choices.

Combat: It's like Dos2 but worse.
Story: The more you play, the more the story becomes generic. It ends in Act 3 with one of the most plain storylines and some of the most basic and dumb villains. Also, near the 'ending,' it doesn't make sense. The ending is pretty much non-existent.
Companions: Companions feel plain, and in most cases, their quests are dumb or unfinished. They hardly interact with each other, just uttering one dumb line sometimes.

The second you enter act III everything starts acting choppy.

I am currently in act 3 and have loved the game so far, but everything in the later game locations takes forever to load as the game feels like it was never tested. It went from having a second or two delay between actions in the first two acts (which I assumed was just minor day 1 bugs), to having anywhere from a minimum 10 seconds of delay, to actual minutes between actions. The game is an 11/10 in the first two acts, and an insta",0

"As someone who loved BG1 and BG2 as a teenager, this game is just not that... Its not at its heart a balder's gate game! I find it so boring to play for a number of reasons and even harder to get around finishing it cause of how buggy and boring the game real is. 
1. The characters are just cheap knock off of other fantasy titles.
ASTARION is just Lestat de Lioncourt from the Anne rice novels. 
Shadowheart is Viconia DeVir 2.0.
GALE is just a male Quiet from metal gear solid 5.

It does not feel like Baldur's gate.  You start out fighting Mind Flayers and such.  I've already reached level 2 and it feels like the game is going to whisk me by the lower levels to get to telling the story they want to tell.  I want to fight kobolds and goblins and orcs.  I don't see a connection to the original Baldur's Gate.  I hope that is not the case.  I don't like Jumpy puzzles.  That is what killed ultima for me.  I'm not feeling it but it is an alpha so I'm hoping this gets better as we go along,0
"The first two acts are excellent, where passion and expertise manage to shine through. The third act fumbles what came before. It's evident that the final acts lies unfinished and rushed. Much of the side content and characters don't receive conclusions or resolutions. The writing suffers the most. Certain character's actions at one of the endings are illogical. Imagine if William Wallace decided to accept king's pardon and proceeded to join him. The complete betrayal of an established character's motivatio",0

"If you're a fan of DOS2 or DND, this game is certainly something for you. Although it's still in EA the first act itself is at least worth 30 hours of content in one playthrough.

You're probably going to end up playing multiple playthroughs though as there are so many different outcomes. Companions are also great, with interesting backstories.

"This game had high expectations for me cause of the previous ones which I played thru multiple times. The third one in the franchise just does not meet any standards of the other games.

"No, this game is not the second coming of Jesus or whatever the overwhelming critical acclaim pretends that it is. It is not an incredible polished pinnacle of design, it is not a masterwork of reactive gameplay, it is not anything that a world so desperately thirsty for a 100+ hour game without any microtransactions is proclaiming it to be.

"The game does an amazing job of implementing the DnD rules and looks fantastic. Unfortunately they screw up the gameplay through fights that are designed to place your group in the worst possible starting positions with enemies already in ambush positions and using AOE attacks on your group before you move so you start fights already losing. They are making these fights puzzles instead of actual group based combat using DnD rules.

I didnt like it because the mobs were so hard I was losing some of my party just in the first act or getting wiped out about 30min into game. Too many cinematics if that is actually possable. I wanted to love it becuase its my kind of game but at full price I just dont have time to mess with it. Just think of how randomly hard divinity orginal sin was. I got a refund. I may pick it up whenever it hits 29.99 or I dont have to work for a living.,0

According to IGN’s Leana Hafer, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a new high-water mark for CRPGs with satisfying combat and excellent writing. The game is set in a beautiful, detailed world stocked with too many fully-realized, powerfully written, and skillfully voiced characters to count.

This is the type of game that only comes around once every several years, easily one of the best games in a year full of amazing releases.

"It is simply marvelous. The amount of player freedom is a bit daunting at first, but eventually clicks into something truly unique and beautiful. Larian took all of the greatness they had been building from D:OS1 and D:OS2 and really expanded on all of it and a pretty amazing way. If you like D&D, get it and thank me later. Great job everyone! This will likely go down as the greatest RPG of all time, and for good reason. 10/10",1

"The way this game currently is I can't recommend anybody to spend money for it.

I came because I loved the old Baldur's Gate games and I love D&D. The promise to make a worthy successor and a proper 5e game was a great lure. It isn't either though.

It's 5e rules with a LOT of homebrew rules which makes it absolutely not like playing D&D. You have melee characters being able to buff/dip/poison themselves to incredible degrees while spellcasting feels super weak. There's high ground rules that make fights m",1
best game ever i luv it,1
"Easily the Best in the Balder's Gate series. The creators did a great job making the game repayable with various consequences based on the decisions you make. I played the Divinity series, and this game is a nice upgrade and homage to that game play from the same creators. This game is Basically a digital version of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.  4.5 stars. would be five if there wasn't various instances of sexual content.",1
"This game does a really solid job of bringing 5th edition D&D into a video game. I haven't played for a little bit because I was waiting for more content to be released, but I am *very* excited for the finished product!",1
"TL;DR: In its current state I really cant recommend this game for anyone planning a serious playthrough. This will hopefully change after some patches, but that doesnt excuse the current situation. 
Larian seems to have a history with delivering games with seriously shitty and unfinished last acts and it sucks they apparently dont change.

First things first: There is a huge discrepancy the perception of the game between people who are still in act 1or 2, people who finished the game and people who finished",0
"Truly one of the best rpg experience I've played in years, no micro transactions, lots of content and devs who actually care to make a great game 10/10 would recommend",1
Been waiting since Throne of Bhaal for a title which does the series justice.  It's finally here and it's spectacular.,1
"Likes: Plays like D&D which I love playing. Game play is very good for the most part but sometimes it has my character move some where rather than stay, attack, hide etc.",1
"took a while to hook me, first baldurs gate i play for more than a couple of hours. Have a lvl 5 party at the moment and its becoming better and better",1
"15 years ago, Baldur's gate 1 & 2 had six characters per party.  Now, with all the advancements and high tech improvements technology has to offer, we improved to four.",0
"Ok ive had this game since it first showed up on Early.  I played some and thought it was ok.  I would take long breaks and check back every now and then.  First of all, the game itself looks and sounds AMAZING!  The game play itself ok.  Now, at this latest patch, I came back again and wow...i mean HOLY FRICKING WOW!!  They have changed alot and I like how you have the ability for a party member to cast a spell to help with rolls.  I have found more new content and it is well done.  All I can say, after on",1
10/10 would recommend. Killer game PLUS all the future DLC content is free? Can't beat that.,1
"Finally finished my first play through... 150 hours, but I left no stone un-turned. Best turn based RPG I've ever played.   The real impact of choices made essentially guarantees I'll be coming back for a second very different play through of almost equal length.  Highly recommended.",1
"Gud game, Love Karlach",1
"If I wanted to play Divinity: Original Sin, then I would go play it. I wanted to play a Baldur's Gate game. This is basically just a Divinity game with the thinnest D&D coating of paint. I was exceedingly excited to play this game at first. I really liked the githyanki/illithid backdrop that they started with. Unfortunately, Larion got the D&D world constantly wrong. They also make things way too difficult to understand and interact with. If it were tabletop, I could ask the DM clarifying questions to under",0
"A 'no' is for Devs to well improve the game before it's official launch.

The good:
1) Character interactions are fun to have. With 7/10 animations and excellent voice acting, it's quite easy to feel for the in-game personalities. It's really the same Mass Effect trilogy experience, and rather enjoyable. 
2) The music. Situational music are spot-on with excellent variations. This is particularly with the Harpies fight. I wonder if the Devs are intending to do all sorts of situational music for even such a t",0
"I finished Act 1 in about 15 hours.  Did everything there was to do. Every side quest I could find until there was literally no more content left for me to do. Didn't really rush. Explored the whole map. 


I really like the game so far, but reviewing to give people a heads up that it's really short right now due to not having the other two acts available.",1
"Takes some getting used to the rules, but once you get it, it just gets better.",1
Something bit me,1
"nice to see a game living up to its expectations, loved Divinity Original Sin II as well!!",1
"Simply awesome. I played Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 plus BG 2 xpacs, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Dragons Age, Origins...etc at release. You get the idea. This type of game is just something I really dig. We've gone through a considerable dry-spell. Then came Pathfinder & PoE (and the remastering of the classics). When I heard about BG3 I was cautiously optimistic, even though it wasn't Bioware. I intentionally didn't play early release (I thought hard about it) because I wanted to experience what happened on",1
Would reccomend to anyone that likes RPGs or DnD,1
"Be warned, this is basically Divinity 3 with a Forgotten Realms skin put over it.

Once you access this, the game is great and will be even better when the bugs/features are ironed out.",1
Amasing,1
This is the best game I've ever played and it simply pushes me out of playing it. This game is nothing but constant save errors to me. That's what I think about when I hear Baldur's gate 3 now. Is save error. Corrupt file. 150+ hours - wasted.,0
For the most part a waste of time and a boring story.,0
That's how games should be (again).,1
"About damn time. 3 years we have waited for the full game release. oh and by the way... no discount on collector's edition, buy a 2nd copy and pay full price if you want the most valuable item: a cloth map.",1
"Never played a game like this before so there was a bit of a learning curve. Once I understood the basics and how everything works, I started to really enjoy what this game has to offer. Tons of content, lots of fun, and plenty of laughs. I highly recommend this game.",1
"Alright, so after a lot of thought in this matter. I just dont really like it. Theres to many dice rolls, for everything. EVERYTHING. Its annoying to miss mundane stuff like the lore on a plaque, and its really annoying to miss dice rolls in conversation. Especially annoying when you are specialized in a talent and keep failing it. It almost forces save-scumming. Which kills the momentum of the game, and you spend forever sitting in load screens because of bad dice rolls. 

Divinity original sin 2 was the p",0
"Honestly, it is a good game, the graphics are nice, but, i don't find the gameplay to be the kind i like, i know it is inspired by d&d, but that is probably my biggest gripe as the gameplay mechanics start involving around luck, plus, i don't really enjoy the way you move around the world either, so, yes the game is good, but it isn't for me",0
"Very good job. Not perfect, but as close as you will ever get. Hoping for a sequel in the works after Larian takes a well deserved break.",1
"I feel like most of the reviews don't properly explain what's wrong with this game. No, it's not bad because the combat system is different from Baldur's Gate 2. No, it's not bad because it's different from 5e. And no, it's not bad because it's not Divinity Original Sin 3. Simply put, Baldur's Gate 3 needs way, way more time in the oven, and even then, some of the fundamental design decisions likely will not be fixed.
Here's the problems...
-Bugs. So many bugs. To Larian's defense it is playable (it's no Wa",0

But the gameplay experience is so incredibly frustrating, and the game is so wildly buggy that it detracts entirely from any fun you might have long-term in figuring out puzzles or enjoying the nuances.

It took all of 90 hours to complete one play-thru and I loved every second of it. There's so much care and attention to detail in this game, it's astounding. The best part is that a second play-thru is actually appealing because I can pick a whole new class to play for a very different experience, not to mention I can also play with friends. 

I can't recommend this game enough.",1
"Alright so here's my official rating of the game as it stands so far:

Combat: 0/10

Enemies can still shoot into the fog cloud as tho it's still there, Darkness does NOTHING!

Great mix of combat and story while making it incredibly replayable.",1

If it wasn't for the quality of the content and the sunk cost fallacy of dropping a playthrough of 70 to 100 hours, I would've quit this game solely for the technical issues.

"Wait for the developers to finish the game, possibly in an Enhanced Edition in a few years.  ""Feature complete"" was a lie, they're missing half the city of Baldur's Gate (that they claimed was in the game) and the quests that would have interacted with it just fizzle out - some of which lock companions into bad endings.  This is a pretty unfortunate discovery after investing the large amount of time required to notice they didn't finish the final act of the game.",0

Great graphics, story, gameplay, role playing, fantastic world... all just great and excellently delivered. Cant stop playing. I just want to live inside this game...",1
"A truly remarkable game, focused on delivering to fans rather than profiting from consumers. The story has been surprising at every turn thus far, and the mechanics are astonishingly deep without being too complex for more casual players. You don't have to know anything about D&D to really enjoy this game, and if you do it is just an added level of enjoyment. 15/10 would recommend to anyone who wants a deep and enthralling story.",1

"In a world of companies like EA, Activision Blizzard or Ubisoft, an independent studio like Larian is a breath of fresh air.

The Divinity: Original Sin saga was already impressive, but Baldur's Gate III takes it to another level. Even in the Early Access stage, you can feel the passion that was poured into the game.

Please, never change Larian.

Many hours of my childhood were spent exploring the early Bioware games, and Larian Studios seems more than up to the challenge of continuing that legacy.

There's an immense amount of good but let me focus on what I can share about the game without spoiling. The game artistically weaves their 3D animation, writing, and the mechanics of Dnd to bring a CRPG to be a Vanguard of quality I haven't seen since Fallout: New Vegas. Exceptional Voice Acting combines with the flowing motion capture ",1

This is a huge turnoff for me, especially since cutscenes are a big part of the game, with close ups constantly reminding me how ridiculous and out of theme my characters look.

As it is right now, i can't recommned a game that can not be played.",0
"Can be a lot of fun, is well written and aesthetically stunning. But the RNG is utter shit and the game will heavily restrict player freedom when they opt for a less RNG dependent play through. In short, if you play solo, were born with any less luck than a an English Royal and don't enjoy being completely fucked by RNG, steer clear of this game. Otherwise, great game.

Baldur's Gate 3 is a sequel to Baldur' s Gate 2 released back in 2000. Its party RPG with turn based combat with core rules from D&D 5th edition. But actually its more like Divinity: Baldur's Sin 3.

This review is subject to change as it is of a very 'Early Access' version of the game.

1: Graphics look good

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

Feels like there are a lot of minor rpg mechanics tossed in for the players, without contributing much to the story or gameplay. E.g. busking for coin

"10/8/20: Ok first off let me say i love this game but i cannot recommend it in its current condition. It is buggy beyond belief, lags non stop, freezes about every ten minutes, and often crashes. I have a $1000 gaming pc and can barely run it more than an hour without crashing. Again i love the game but as of right now it is nearly unplayable.

"A proper weird simulation of 5E D&D. Don't need to know anything about the pervious games at all. This is a crash course into D&D lore, not Tolkien influenced, not human focused, a torrent of the unique mythology of D&D. The turn based system is better than original Baldur's Gate and it feels like actually playing D&D. There are a lot of options based on who your character is which means replaying this is a must. This version of 5E D&D is a good influence on anyone who wants to dungeon master the table top ",1

Larian told us, that they needed to cut the complete upper city and the content which was planned for this. I played for so many hours and some stories at the end just don’t feel fulfilling. The bigger problem I had were the performance issues which came with act 3. The last 3 hours where you go for the final, I played the game with 10 fps",0

1. When you're exploring the world you control one character at a time and the rest of your party auto-follows you.

If you've played Divinity, it feels a lot like that. A charming narrative, lots of opportunities for creativity, excellent voice acting, and a fun way to experience content in the DnD setting. Should be friendly to new players and seasoned RPG'ers alike. Decisions you make have real impact on the world in fun and interesting ways. Can be played with up to 4 people cooperatively.

From a super-nerd who played Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 back in the day and who's followed the Forgotten Realms lore since the 90s: this game may well be one of the best Forgotten Realms/D&D properties ever. I cannot get over what an absolute banger of a game this is.,1

Going against grain here. Character creation is neat and scenes are fantastic. I was wowed indeed. Game is amazing. I could not get used to the camera and movement.

Short answer, no.

Through Act 1, things are great, actually.  Not much of the story is revealed just yet and the bugs are few and uninterruptive of game-play.

However, Act 2 brings about an entirely different experience.  When all of your party members are hitting on you and have similar personal conflicts with every other character and with all of them having daddy issues, you begin to understand that these characters were not entirely fleshed out in the story.

I was expecting to relive my childhood playing a game like Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance but instead i just got an exact copy of Divinity. I'm not gonna say this is a bad game because I'm sure, like Divinity, it's going to be a solid game. I'm just really disappointed with all the hype that this was not what i was expecting at all.

Second Playthrough: Malenthaur the Terrible. A power-hungry human necromancer who sadistically took pleasure in bringing pain and misery unto others in the name of his depraved god and enslaved all of Faerûn.

The Oath Breaker logic is broken.  Let me see.  My group gets attacked first by a bunch of Homicidal Maniacs who worship an Evil Goddess who chop peoples bodies up and torture them.  I'm the Oath Breaker because I kill them.  Give me a break LOL.",1

the story is well written and game play is quite fun but also lags quite a bit even though was running smoothly just a moment ago. The worst part is the auto save feature it is completely useless. You will defeat a main act boss and the game will not save. It expects you to save even though most modern games that are made correctly save after every major event. This one seems to lack that modern attribute for some reason. Instead it mainly auto saves at random times or when you camp.,0
"(This is a review targeted more towards I think the average RPG lover). I think Baldur's Gate 3 has a lot of strong aspects in terms of graphics, cutscenes, and dialogue so far, but might be a hard miss in terms of combat.

Going into this game, I wasn't quite aware that the combat would be like D&D (I figured there would be classes other stuff similar to D&D from what I read online but, to my understanding, lots of fantasy games borrow a lot from D&D in general). I played Divinity Original Sin 2 a bunch an",0
"Pretty disappointed after reading such glowing reviews.
I have played pretty much every fantasy game since the first Ultima and the game is fine, its not great. It doesnt grab me and IMHO is not as good as Divinity Original Sin 2.

The worst part so far was during Lord Gortash's coronation, when the FPS dropped to 2, causing huge lags (I thought the game would crash).

I was playing at Ultra with no issue until act 3, and tried to lower the settings but it made no difference at all. No matter how low the graphic settings are, if the DSLL is on or off, th",0

"Absolutely delightful single-player experience! The characters and setting are immersive and align with what I imagined an RPG version of D&D to be. The graphics are surprisingly gorgeous. The character are lovable, even the ones you don't imagine will be- though the Gith never stops being intolerable and Shadowheart gets more annoying as time goes on. The multi-player experience isn't much fun, as only the host really gets to interact much with the storyline while others spectate between battles, but for s",1

"Buggy mess that crashes within 6 minutes of starting the game. The companies only solution is several pages of ""fixes"", time consuming experiments and ""this might work"" suggestions. I know this is early access, but the fact I can barely get into the game without a crash from clicking on an item in the opening area tells me rather than worrying about Gnomes and Bards they should handle the basic issues. I cannot get a refund (I have already tried). It has been over 2 years since this came out for public use,",0
"Has such high replay value! Literally hours of content, different stories and choices to explore, phenomenal voice acting, sound design, and attention to detail, to name a few positives.

But, 12 hours in with the clonky game play, point and click mouse navigation, and frequent game crashes I have a suspicion this is more a situation where it is cool to like Balder's Gate 3 more than anyone actually likes Balder's Gate 3. 

So, I'm going to do you a solid so you don't waste $60 like I did. I will risk the fanboy rage, and point out that the Emperor is in fact naked. This game is in fact... an underwhelming snooze fest.",0

Best DnD experience in video game format. I think it really brings back the war gaming/RP into RPGs.,1

This game is amazing. As someone who plays DnD often it was nice to get into more of it without having to wait for the next session and all that comes with that. The first 2 chapters were great and while initially the third one had its issues the developers have given great follow up and i throughly enjoyed my adventure/endings. If i could give one tip is that long rest more than usual so you dont miss camp events xD. Defenetly Game of the year!!!,1
Still in it's early stages but is a beautiful looking game with fun combat mechanics and pretty wonderful visual respresentation of the world of Fearun. The multiplayer campaign is super fun with friends too! But you can still experience a very fun and thought out story playing solo. Excited to see where this game goes,1
"I have to (slightly)dislike and not recommend this game for those who like to just play a Baldur's Gate game. I bought and played early access and then lost my character on the new download. So keep that bias in mind.

I'll start with the game's Pros:  
*The graphics and ability/magical effects are really cool.
* Can still kill pretty much anyone without breaking the game.
* Game lets you kill yourself by trying to jump off cliffs.
*There are cool game mechanics:

Act I is great, Act II is good but during Act III the game falls apart: it's buggy and clearly rushed. Larian was so proud about releasing this game a month early but if that means a game full of bugs then I don't want it (I know they did this because they were scared of Starfield being released at that time but that's no excuse). They released a huge patch to fix a lot of the problems",0
"*update* they've patched it. Now crashes every 4-5 hours instead of 10 minutes. changed review to positive
P.S. 10/10, game of the year, no jokes

Game itself is great, however, UNPLAYABLE

After completion of the first 'big quest' (~10 hours of smooth gameplay) the game started to crash ocasionnaly once per hour. Not an experience that I can accept. But it's really frustrating, cause I had to re-play around 3 hours of content of 12 hours played total.

Cmon, Larian -_-",1
"Liked: Combat system.

Dislike:
Sword Coast has been turned into a bunch of sex craved maniacs.
There is too much focus on NPC's trying to have sex not one but all of them, force feeding this, during the game.
Very unrealistic, a fling in a tavern or at a shrine like in Ultima 7, that was nice. Even in the Witcher series it was done with some class, but this is just trashy.

It's a major step up in presentation from other iso RPGs. A lot of world interactions and ways to game the system like you could in a tabletop.

"As it stands it is a solid game, though it has a little too much Divinity in it (environmental/ground effects created by spells that normally don't do so in D&D 5e) for my tastes. Bear in mind the product is very clearly unfinished (early access after all) and will be buggy/unpolished, but it's still good enough to dump 20+ hours into. :)",1

"though it isn't a bad game, it's far from worth the price. lots of bugs, cluttered uis, bad tutorials, and in my opinion- very generic for 2023. its a fun game, but i would wait till the price is knocked down, its not all that the community and critics hype it up to be.",0
Gamifies some of the 5e rules but overall a very enjoyable and well done game.,1
"No Spoilers Here:
After my first completion i sat at the title screen for about 30min. My emotions in general shambles. This is one of those games where its a damn shame you cant experience it for the first time again. I somehow survived seeing any spoilers so every part of the game was right in my face when things happened. Everything about it is wonderful. Characters, location, sound, story, amazing till the end.

"TL;DR:  Amazing true-to-source D&D 5th edition game. Great writing, great characters, great combat. 500+ hours in, and all I want is more.

Disclaimer: You will see a great many comparisons, sometimes negative, to Baldur's Gate 3 and Larian's previous hit title Divinity: Original Sin 2. This is because they are both turn-based combat high fantasy games based on D&D. The defining difference is with Baldur's Gate 3, they had the tools and permission to use D&D property forthright, and created a wonderfully di",1
Been a Baldur's Gate fan since the 1st one.  This is a game to get!,1
"One of the best RPGs I've ever played. Definitely the best party-based RPG I've played.
Immersive characters, great NPCs, loads to explore and so many options and paths to solve or blow up problems. This is a total winner.",1
Game good. Me like game.,1
never played a crpg before but this shit rules,1
Meh.  Nothing new here that we haven't seen in so many games.  I don't know why this was considered the Second Coming for CRPGs.  FYI I really enjoyed DOS and DOS2.  Kind of feel let down on this one.,0
One of the greatest stories I've ever had the pleasure to experience.,1

It Gets the following Scores over-all

1/10 -",0
"The last time i ever felt this excited to play an RPG game was the first Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate 3 for me is an adaptation and upgrade of their last series Divinity Original Sin 2 and they have curated a beautiful experience set in the D&D world.

When i first played the game, chapter 1 and 2 were fantastic, but the last chapter felt a little under baked (KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE RELEASE). I'm really excited to play my second playthrough!",1
Holy Fucking Shit Dude,1
"This game is great. There's not much else you need to know. But if you're curious about a strangers thoughts, here ya go:

The writing in this game is great. No character I've run into in close to 50 hours has had the stock ""Can I help you?"" dialogue. Each character has something interesting going on with it, and that makes all of your actions feel impactful. Not only that, but each side quest feels in service of the ultimate goal of getting that damn tadpole out of your head. There are also plenty of side ",1
"Really enjoying the game so far. I've done 2 play through's and was sincerely impressed by the open choices and how they effected the rest the game. To many rpg's don't allow true player freedom in choices or the outcome of said choices remains the same no matter what a player chooses, so I am really looking forward to the finished product. And fully recommend this game to any dnd or rpg fans",1
"Larian studios did it again, all of their games are absolute bangers and this one isn't any different. Everything you could possibly want from an DnD like RPG is here: Badass fights, Dice rolling, Funny interactions, Free will to do whatever you want, Romance, and so much more. Definitely worth the $0 I spent on it.",1
"Just read the other reviews, I just want to give it my thumbs up too.",1
"I know everyone is raving about this game but after playing that monument of perfect that was DOS2 I just can't stand this subpar experience. The combat is so boring. The story is meh, the characters meh, the UI meh... seriously, don't waste your money like me. Just play DOS2.",0

"Everything about this game is amazing.  I had this since beta and I have to say this game has me hooked 1000%
There are some minor issues that i encounter at times with battle etc.  Don't know if it is involved with my pc or not, but it shouldn't but besides the very minor small issues I've encountered so far i would recommend this game to any RPG/ DND fans out there.  You're missing out if you pass up this game.",1

I don't know what it is lately with story writers for these RPG games lately, but they are terrible.  You want to know the story line here?

"I've waited 23 years since the original Baldur's Gate 2's launch for a sequel to this excellent series. Played both in Early Access and playing right now and I have to say, it has exceeded my expectations 10 times over. 

This is a fantastic game for any RPG fan out there (especially if your into DnD!).",1

"Decent game ruined by gratuitous nudity and nonsense. This is supposed to be a story, not porn. 60 bucks pissed away.",0
It has been a long time since a game was able to suck me in for hours at a time. It has been an even longer time since a game has had enough content that I can play as much as I want and not worry about finishing the game too soon. This is the game that will remind you why you love to play video games.,1
"Great replay value. Every time we started a new character, we would discover something new!",1
"Playing the game for many hours I can say that Chapters 1 & 2, great game!  Sounds, music, graphics, effects, performance, story and characters, all great.

Once you get to chapter 3 however, it all turns to crap.  The game lag is so horrible in chapter 3 that the game is literally unplayable.  I have lag spikes in chapter 3 that last upwards of 10 minutes.  I have the game installed on an ssd with an icore 11 processor, 32 gig ram and a gtx 1080 ti.  I've set the graphic settings from low to ultra and ever",0

Edit: there's apparently a hidden ""pure path,"" but why hide that? It should be more obvious for people who want to remain pure. 

So, perhaps once I play this hidden pure path I will change my review.",0
"The game is amazing, a total jewel, 10/10. I can't explain how good this game is. Every scene, character, story, etc, are fun and invites you to play more.

The reason why i don't recommend this game right now (AUGUST 17, 2023) is that the save system is tottaly f*cked. I'm almost finishing the game and i have to rollback hours of play because i don't know what is happening to the saves. I found in internet that a lot of people has the same issue since last patch, but this ruined my experience. Save games i",0
very SUCK that players cannot modify the racial of the characters they have created. Unless they decide to restart the game from beginning.（There is no achievement reward after installing MOD). It's too frustrating.,0
its like chess.. single moves then wait for the next player.,0
"Things I like: I like the use of the DnD system and the spell effects and dice modifiers are nice and open. Character creation is fun. 
Things I don't like: I hate the movement system. It's just bad. The game tends to not recognize bridges over chasms and if you  simply click on the other side of the bridge your character will wander around the wrong direction because it doesn't know what to do. 
It is way too easy to click on scenery when moving. If the camera removed a tree from view but you click the map",0
This is the best game I've ever played 10/10,1

"If you like Dungeons and Dragons buy the game. 60 bucks is a big ask, but I've paid more for MUCH worse games on pc/console. If this game isn't worth that price tag, I truly don't know what is.",1
Having put this much time into a single playthrough without trying to accomplish most side quest is a testament to the value of the game.,1
I love this game. I kill everything.,1
"I don't get what the fuss is about; this game is.... boring.  It looks good, voice acting is ok... but that's it.  It's a boring game.  I miss Neverwinter Nights.  If you want to play a good game, similar to this, just buy the original Neverwinter Nights and avoid this.",0
"I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm still having tons of fun. However, during many boss fights, I feel like I need to get lucky to win after resetting the saves numerous times. But only because I don't know what I'm doing.",1
"Larian, hello beautiful, hello lovely",1
"Although I would like a bit more in the head selection, I have loved this game. There are consequences for your actions if you don't save scum. The characters you meet are all unique. I never know what I am going to run into during my walks around. Combat is challenging, and unique. During a time of disinterest in gaming, this game has reignited my spark.",1
"So now that the game came out, several things I enjoyed in early access have changed and my review has also changed.  Character building isn't really a thing anymore.  You can pick a race, but it does nothing for your ability score.  A half orc and a halfling are going to have the same attributes as a barbarian, cleric or wizard.  They have some racial traits that are different, and I suspect people are just going to pick the ones who have the best dark vision.  This wasn't in early access, so it is a bit o",0

First of all, this is absolutely a game of the year contender. It has a rich and complex story, every choice you make will have an impact, all of the companion backgrounds are well written, pretty engaging turn based combat, bear🐻 and no microtransactions.

fun game but too hard,0
"Highly anticipated - deeply disappointed. This is the most laborious game ever imagined. The cumbersome fighting system, and limitations on world exploration, makes the game somehow disjointed from any game previously created. Its uniqueness makes it a bland recipe tasted by few, so don't expect the whole world to run after it due to the uncritical rave reviews out there, in here- especially since not everyone likes to eat from such a cheap dish in any case - they prefer other genres or style of genre.

tried to refund and since i cannot might as well leave a review. if you love a game that you will never finish due to how stupidly complex and hard it is like every forum and youtube video having the same issue than this game is for you. karmic dice does nothing to help and on the easiest setting it is still extremely insane. let alone a gnarly bug where when  you play split screen coop that character you made cannot leave your party. so it adds to the difficulty of the game as well which is fantastic as if,0
The game is so good. It got me to play a new game genre.,1
"This game is great and very fun which is very rare nowadays when it comes to video games. I played 44 hours of early access which went up to the underground. The best thing about this game is that nearly all of your choices actually matter and there are a lot of different ways to progress through a situation. My most memorable moments in the game were *spoilers* telling the wife her husband is gone without having her kill herself (super sad swamp witch quest), raising the baby griffin (after murdering its p",1
"The game is good. The voice acting and bestiary are great. I just wish the developers would stop ruining a VIDEO GAME by filling it with stuff nobody asked for, like vampires having sex with bears, and people actively don't want to see this stuff.

Crashes in character creation on the lowest settings. Horribly optimized. There's no excuse that a computer that can run Read Dead Redemption 2 cant run this game.,0
DnD for the win,1
"It’s so nice to get a great game that does not require some sort of season pass to be complete and does not have a “next gen tax” (aka greed) of $10! The story is great, the gameplay is tons of fun, and the depth of choices is extensive! If this isn’t GotY 2023, someone’s cheating.

I’ve mostly played this on the Steam Deck and it looks surprisingly good at 30fps with fsr2.2 on ultra/quality and medium to low settings. It gets a little choppy in the big city, but it is still very playable.",1
"This is definitely one of the best contenders for the best game I have ever played. The story is incredible, your choices ACTUALLY MATTER (unlike a good portion of games that claim that), the visuals are incredible, the music doesn't get repetitive or irritating, even when listening to the same soundtrack for hours at a time (which you don't need to, I just enjoyed vibing and not doing anything in camp for a while). The characters truly do develop and change depending not only on what you do, but also what ",1
"STEAM STOP ASKING FOR REVIEWS. I give every game that asks for a review a negative one.

It hurt to do it for this game. It is such an amazing game. Great writing, story, characters. Really nailed down the feel of DnD in a game even if it is overzealous with the dice rolls.",0
"Positives - 
No micro transactions or Day 1 in game DLC full of stuff that should be in the game in the first place. 
No in-game purchases of useless cosmetics or Game passes full of XP boosts because the game was made 10x more grindy to make people purchase the XP boosts. 
No preorder bonuses/limited time offers
No internet connection or DRM bullshit so I can play on my steam deck

It follows the D&D ruleset, and for that it's not a high action fast paced game. Don't expect that. But the tactics and difficulty are excellent, and the story is that little cherry on top.",1
"Act 1 was fine and of good quality, act 2 it started to dip but was still good, act 3 shit the bed so hard I wonder how it is in the same game as act 1.

First complaint, character creation kinda sucks and doesn't have any sliders to make YOUR character, you have to use the preset faces (most are ugly).  Faces in general are 2 white/ 2 black/ 2 hispanic/ 2 asian and the voices are about the same with 1 male/female for each respective race.

yes it is that good. I'm loving it, I love the conversations, the rolls, what can you do, what can you discover, how far can you take things before they go out of hand? this game is giving you freedom. not even talking about combat, which is also a lot more vertical than DOS2. even though I do not like DND past 3.0 this game gets my full support.",1
"This is looking like it's going to be a great game.  Yeah, a few bugs but nothing crazy.  It is early access after all.  Based on the length of the early access portion which I heard was the first chapter, this seems like it may be a short game (which would suck).  Either way, it's going to be a blast.  It's also nice that they aren't hitting you up with microtransactions.  Hopefully, that stays out of the final product.",1

My only real gripe, there needs to be the option to mass move 'wares' (items to be sold) between party members, I'm sure there are other improvements to be made to inventory management as well. I spend what feels like half my time managing my inventory, its definitely the worst aspect of this game for me. It was my main gripe with DOS2 as well. Also, even though there are some",1

"Ok, first playthrough done, and it's been a great time! The story is great, the characters are all unique, and combat is fun yet challenging(as long as you don't barrelmancer everything lol) downside: conversation can move really quickly into romance options, no I don't wanna make out with you after you showed me a cool trick. maneuvering the camera is a pain at times. and if you don't keep up with all your characters can do, you may forget about all the actions they can do.

"I never played BG1 or 2, so I can't speak as to how worthy of a successor this game is to those titles. But it doesn't really matter, because Baldur's Gate 3 is the pinnacle of the medium and something anyone with even a passing interest in video games should play.

"This game is on many levels an absolute masterpiece, and I'd strongly recommend it for lovers of CRPG's and D&D. The attention to detail, the strong characters and the way that lore unfolds is classic D&D, as is the mix of humour and genuine epic adventure.

Great story, fun combat, emotional moments supported by wonderful voice performances- not to mention the replay ability.

BG3 manages to deliver everything I loved most from my favorite games like DA:O, ME2, Witcher 3, etc. 

Highlights for me include: 

1) The game excels at allowing you to role play your character,

"I personally don't like it. It's EA and all but there are many things missing for me in the game like certain spells and right now Berserkers, that I love in DnD at home and many things aren't planned that I am used to play in DnD for example races, patrons and certain sub classes, so I didn't even bother much with the game.",0

"Cant even call this a game yet.  A lot is going to have to change before release.  Its currently trash and unplayable.  They should be ashamed for calling this baldurs gate.  Overly complicated menus.  Its not point and click.  Poor hints for direction.  Easy to get into the open world farther than your current skills will keep you alive making it very difficult on any lvl.  Yes its pre-release, and no its not worth the purchase.",0

The Dungeons And Dragons spell and action list gives a massive amount of tools, and the games gives you many different situations to use them in.

 Dialogue is reactive, creative, and authentic to the spirit of high fantasy. Every NPC has their own, voice acted dialogue that is unique to them. Every single one. I have spent hours walking aroun",1

Combat is engaging, the new rules and flexible multi-classing let's you get rid of the classic party combination, and being able to reclass even your companions, so you can play your way, and still get the great storyline that comes with them is a really great feature

Way too much content, too many branching narratives to keep up with. Tons of voiced dialogue you have to listen to all the time, way too many unique characters to possibly remember, and I could probably forgive all of this if not for a few glaring issues.

As soon as i hit the first battle scenario it crashes, or as soon as i finish the scenario it crashes.  I havent played more than 10 minutes of this game, character creation included.  I paid full price,  so i wonder how long this game will sit before i becomes playable.  I sure could have used that money on something that actually works.  Not impressed",0

When I originally saw Baldur's Gate 3 come to early access on Steam I was unable to play it because it wasn't available on GeForce Now.  In the last few days it went live on GeForce Now so I made the purchase.

This RPG is incredibly refreshing and offers so many ""what if I try..."" options. It has been stable and ""mostly"" bug-free since its initial release. The QA team at Larian Studios deserves a raise, and other AAA game developers should take notes from this company on how to release a successful game. While the story is good, it can be a little cheesy at times and most characters have their own flaws, which requires some creative problem-solving. Additionally, there have been a few unexpected surprises in the",1

Does encourage save scumming pretty hard though...",1

"Amazing and immersive experience. My first ever CRPG and/or Baldur experience. Can't find time to sleep in between play sessions. I'm new tot he universe so catching up the lore and sinking it in, makes me aloof at times, but the experience is unhindered.

- Good sound, although music could be better and more ""unique"".
- Very deep systems and progressions. Lots of ""conditionals"".

"Really wish I refunded this before the 2 hours mark. Game is too luck based, dmg ranges should be tighter, hit rates should be higher, health pools should be higher. The game being so based around luck means fights are won and lost around luck. Its one thing to have luck in the back end of the game influencing things, but the combat in this is literally just reload til you get lucky. Not sure why this game is so hyped, it has a really cool story line but as far as combat mechanics this game is insanely aver",0
"This game isn't perfect, but it's damn close to it! The storylines, dialogue, freedom, and world are all beautifully built. Combat is excellent. Characters are detailed and all have interesting storylines. Highly recommend for any DnD fans, or RPG fans. Worth every penny.",1

I've attempted to request a refund, but steam keeps denying it based on how long I have played. Avoid this game if you care about playing it in a timely fashion.  (I have tried every known method of correcting this issue, no luck)",0

who else still hasnt finished the game but started 3 other playthroughs? its not just me right,1
This is so much fun and a great intro to D&D. I loved getting to customize my character and being able to play with my husband and his character as well.,1
When is the final version to be delivered?,1
The story-line and game-play is nothing short of remarkable. It is tricky to manoeuvre the camera angles and sometimes frustrating but the game content more than makes up for it.,1
Too hard. Could have been good otherwise.,0
"It's like Divinity: Original Sin, but better. It's the lonely person's D&D group. It's the ultimate chaos gremlin, murder hobo, flirty bard simulator",1
Love it wish they had more spell varieties & Melee skills love the enemy diversities. Personally wish they introduced some of the main characters that can join your party a bit different ex. Astarion love him but just a better introduction or cinematic maybe. Overall LOVE THE GAME SOO MUCH <3,1
GAME OF THE YEAR HANDS DOWN,1
"Too good even in Early stages of development

"Absolutely phenomenal game. Probably the best game I have ever played, and I doubt anything will be able to top it for some time.",1
"Basically unplayable for me at this point. Consistent crashes throughout the first few hours of gameplay, mostly on the vulkan client. However, the vulkan option is the only one which allows the game to run at more than 10 fps, even at lower settings. Both the vulkan and DX11 options will drop to nearly 0 fps seemingly at random, forcing a restart, which then loses all recent progress. Very promising looking gameplay for the short 10 or so minutes I get to play at a time, but until these performance issues ",0

This game is gonna be a masterpiece.",1

"My favourite games back in the day were the Bioware D&D games. I was not expecting much nostalgia but I was wrong. I am a fan of the Divinity games so knew this game would be beautiful with good gameplay, It's like Divinity on crack with D&D within it all. In love with this game and already playing all the different classes and races. Looking forward to full release but will be playing the heck out of the early access version till then :)

"This is a great game. The first two acts are amazing and extremely fun.

But the third is just plagued with technical problems. Not just me either, at least two of my friends suffered the same issues. Extreme lag, memory leak errors, massive frame rate drops. I am not exaggerating when I say the technical issues of act 3 remind me of fallout new vegas on launch day. Extremely fun, but man, you gotta deal with so much technical crap to get to the good game. 

If you purchase now you're paying for the first t",0
"A great game especially as a gate way for those looking to get into DnD.
The game is extremely reactive tho reactivity decreases as you move from ACT 1 to 3 although the epilogues added with patch 5 are great.
PS: At least for some consequences this game takes choices very seriously. A good thing in my book but may not be the same for others.",1
Cool game.,1
"Super fun game-play and a very interesting story, however it is obviously still in EA as there are some big bugs and performance issues in places but they aren't game killers and the game is for sure worth it. Story is still unfinished for the moment so if you want to play the game for the story, perhaps wait till its out of EA.",1
I can NEVER replay games... this is an exception.,1
"Have you ever got stuck on a boss in a game and smashed your head against it for hours and hours and hours? I have.

Well BG3 creates an environment where you can do that if you want. Or you can talk your way out of it and skip the fight entirely. Or you can join the bad guy and take over the world. Or you can find a secret switch that opens a door leading to a hallway you didn't know existed. In such a hallway you might find a tactical way to defeat this boss using the environment around you with relative ",1
Its a good game but its multiplayer is unbelievably buggy. doesn't deserve 96% positive atm.,0

Very good game!!! :),1
Great Storytelling,1

3 years of waiting. Worth it.,1
"Still yes, cannot wait for further implementations",1
"You're going to see a lot of reviews like this. Its early access and, honestly, pretty unplayable at the moment. Tons of core classes are missing, many archetypes are missing, but the basis is there. The game controls very similarly to Divinity 2, which is a good thing. I have faith in Larion that this game will become something amazing, but I cannot advise buying it at this time.",1
"The game is so immersive, and the lore is built in wonderfully. The characters are unique and each have their lovable moments. The basics of play were easy to grasp, despite my having never played DnD before.",1
"""My name is Lorroakan. I offer a generous reward to any brave adventurer who finds and brings me the Nightsong, a powerful artifact (blablabla...)"".
Well, this was another fetch quest I casually took at the very beginning of the game, during my early access playthroughs.
In July 2023, I finally found the Nightsong somewhere after Act 1.

"It's a great game, even as it exists in EA.

I don't find the characters particularly interesting, engaging or charismatic, but maybe they will grow on me as their stories progress throughout the full release. 

There is no body presets or body sliders, so your barbarian has skinny noodle arms, and this for me is a problem and immersion breaking. 

But the graphics for an isometric are fantastic, the combat is satisfying, strategic and at times challenging with great spell effects, sound design and an impac",1
"I'm doing my best to like this game, but it is lacking important quality of life improvements.

I can't pause during conversation or cutscenes. At best I can put it in turn based mode outside of those situations. I feel like I need to save every two steps because the game can drop a cutscene on me and I lose progress if I need to stop.

The game does several dice rolls without warning or pausing, I often don't even know what it was throwing for most of the times.

If you are expecting anything from this game relative to the last ones that you have played and enjoyed (i.e. Baldurs Gate)- don't. This is not the hack and slash fantasy fiction epic you will want it to be, I don't think it ever will be.

"Joys:
Gah, it's pretty
Great voice acting
Good music
Good art direction
Good customization, but nothing ridiculous (no 6ft halflings, etc)
SOLID, intuitive gameplay

Frustrations:
A few crashes here and there
Still slim on the races and classes just yet
Accidentally drinking potions
Accidentally walking off ledges when you clearly wouldn't
Accidentally ending your turn with your back to the enemy

"AVOID THIS GAME. 
The main story line is a rip off of divinity sin 2. Starts in a sinking ship, start with a shackle (brain bug for BG3, collars for divinity sin 2.) This game is full of bugs and glitches. The combat system also a shotty rip off of DS2. This game is in no way a descendant  of the Baldur's Gate games. It's not even close to emulating Dungeons and Dragons in both combat system and lore. It tears it's combat style from DS2 as well, and it's a poor replica. The movement is unintuitive and slugg",0

Too many game breaking bugs. Not acceptable it was ever released this broken. I was deep into the game and now my save is completely ruined because of bugs. Never buying a game from this studio again.,0
"5 times this game has crashed on me. During the last crash, it lost 3 hours of gameplay, despite numerous autosaves and manual saves during that 3 hours. Don't waste your money.

However the point and click is meh.

Also beastiality, gross bro come on. I am sure the furries love it as they love sex with animals but the regular person should disagree.",0
"Well, I gotta say it. I owe the Developers an apology. For what felt like forever ago I saw it in Early Access and felt doubtful in getting it. I simply bought 1 too many Early Access games that were never going to be finished and had written off BG3 as another one.

And damn does it feel good to be wrong.

I had been really enjoying it and for once I'm not having one of my fits where I keep restarting the game and remaking my character. I usually always feel like ""I could make a better character then this!",1

"If i had not already invested the money i would not buy again. 
The story line is incomplete. 
You are forced into a set of companions that are all broken in one way or another and have some special drama. This feels like the game is forcing you in a direction. There are choices but very little difference in outcome based on those choices.
 I find all of the companion possibilities annoying. 
The only Rogue NPC is awful and annoying and broken in such a way that if you are not prone to evil you will have to",0

"The game is very in depth and a fantastic story throughout the game. This includes the main quest, side quests, and especially the companion quests. There are so many emotions that the devs did such a fantastic job including that it felt like a top-tier dnd game that someone like critical role or D20 make.

"Larian, Your game is truly beautiful. I hope many more beautiful pieces come from you.",1
GAME OF THE YEAR WORTHY. NO QUESTION WORTH A BUY !!!!! People will complain that later acts aren't like act 1. but part of it is the newness of the game and the first time playing experience. of course a crpg is going to funnel down to get to the end. I think this is game of the year!,1

"Has potential but lacks D&D rules. There are no modifiers to rolls, TRUE STRIKE is NOT something a monster should always have at 1st level, AI needs adjusted as it always does the optimal thing against you, which doesn't reflect monsters well.",0

Will look at this again in a year, but there are far better things you can spend this amount of money on.",0
"There were points in this game when I nearly cried with joy and surprise.  I spent many hours on multiple play-throughs of BG and BG2.  I haven't finished this yet, but I'm close.  I've seen the evil and the good, and found it in my decisions.  It's rare to get self-awareness from a game.  And to get glimpses of ""friends"" from 20 years ago.  Truly touching.  Thank you, thank you so much.",1

"Gamebreaking bugs like invisible dialogues that go on in the background preventing you from saving. Lost 1.5 hours of time due to this. It does not go away with rests, nor with restarting the game, nor with pushing #s to ""choose between invisible dialogue choices"". 

Other glitches like companions being trapped in ceilings or behind walls, breaks in video/clothing during cutscenes, etc.

Highly recommend holding purchase for atleast 3-4 months.",0
Great game lovingly crafted by gifted developers. An essential RPG to play.,1

Top 1 RPG in the last 10 years. Better than Elden Ring and GOW:Ragnarok.",1

"Wait till its out of alpha. Playing with a friend, and if I wasn't I'd quit playing it. Every time I play, I encounter at least one bug. Could be as small as a spell path not being labeled as interrupted(frequent), to the camera bugging out(Frequent), worst I've had is not being able to interact with items(twice in 30 hrs.). This studio is capable of better as Divinity shows, and I'm sure this game will be just as good when the time comes, but save your money and wait.",0

"I've thoroughly enjoyed my 150 hours that included a balanced and tactician playthrough. The game is phenomenal, the creativity and joy in combat success is unparalleled, and the story/choices is pretty good too. But there is plenty of room for improvement. The inventory system leaves you putzing around for long periods of time and breaks the flow of the game. There are long story beats that don't involve combat or huge exposition so feel pretty slow. There is not a very good progression in gear- I had a lo",1

Told it was a bug and to delete all saves. Yeah, that's the ticket. Typical release from a developer that has reached too far.",0
"More then i expected for EA to be honest. It is not there yet, but it is clear that it is on the right path. 
I have confidence in Larian. One can feel that they care deeply about this game and want to craft it into something special. They also have the skill, the attitude and the right ideas to accomplish that. 
Some of the mechanics are no less then ground breaking for the genre (Jumping, Pushing enemy`s of ledges). The game offers freedom of choice never seen before in a Baldur`s Gate title. It lets you ",1
"This is one of the few games I've purchased for full price in my lifetime.  I was a big fan of BG2 and couldn't ignore the hype train surrounding BG3, so I picked it up.  I didn't enjoy DOS or DOS 2, so maybe I should've known ahead of time that I just don't enjoy Larian-made games, but I wanted to give this game a chance, and I fully regret my purchase. 

First off, I really hate the way the controls are set up in Larian's games.  Isometric games like BG2 and Pillars of Eternity 1+2 control beautifully wit",0

"I started four new characters before I finished my first playthrough because I could not wait to see how different builds would play, and despite taking my time thoroughly exploring I am still discovering new things in the game. Very well written story, great music, engaging characters, and a world that encourages you to explore. This is one of the very few games I have purchased at full price and it is worth every penny and then some.",1
"Right. So I previously gave this game a thumbs up during the early access with the caviat about the sexual depravity. I still thought the rest of the game was good enough. But bestiality a goddamn dick slider in character creation are just WAY too much, not to mention the whole ""choose your gender identity"" nonsense. Just a few years ago that thing was an uncomfortable joke in a South Park game, but Larian went and actually did it. I'm embarrassed and ashamed of this game, no amount of good writing and inte",0

This is in the first act that people have been playtesting for years, I want to enjoy the game but if the well playtested part has these issues i'm not optimistic for the new areas.

"Huge fan of Divinity 2 and the older Baldur's Gate games but this one just is not my cup of tea.  Started out having a really difficult time creating a character I actually was happy with, during which I was reminded why I dislike 5e so much.  I know this is personal taste but the removal of things like moon elves still really grinds me.

Haven't played long enough to give a comprehensive review. But if developers are reading this I'll mention just in case: RPGs, even the best ones, often give you lots of small stories and over time players learned to recognize those ""CHUNKS"" of content. A truly magical experiences are the ones that manage to mold all the experiences into one strong narrative.",1

"So, after 10+ hours of gameplay it became apparent that this game, while based on D&D and makes the attempt, does not follow D&D rules at all.

Every single character regardless of class being able to disengage as a bonus action AND THEN ATTACK was making me loose my mind, this alone makes rouges pointless as it is one of their special features for picking the class.

Best game I've ever played from Larian- so much nuance and so much story and interesting mechanics.,1
"Not only the best CRPG but possibly the best role playing game of all time.

The dialogue, plot and characters are all exceptional, but what truly sets this game apart is its reactivity to your character. I played through the first 20 hours before re-rolling a new character and was blown away by how different the experience was.

This game comes closer to the narrative freedom and reaction enabled by pen and paper RPGs than I would have thought possible.

Pros:

The game looks great, I don't have a top of the range graphics card but I'm well within the minimum specs and even with some of the options toned down the games graphics and environments still look amazing.

"For a game that has been in early access for several years, you'd think the game wouldn't be so messy on release but you'd be wrong, because you would be wasting several hours of your life trying to play this game just because it decides to be stupid with no control over it on your part. I suggest waiting till everything has been properly fixed and not dealing with the mess that it is right now.",0

"Can't Progress Due to Bug

I was willing to put up with a lot of time-wasting, immersion-breaking bugs because I was so invested in the story, but I'm finally giving up.

The actual intended game experience was great. The stories are compelling from the broad strokes down to the rich dialogue, and the way they interconnect is impressive--and ambitious, as it creates many, many ""edge case"" situations that need to be accounted for on every level from writing to (especially) engineering. Clearly many of these ",0

From a story rich in lore to graphics that dazzle with how beautifully detailed they are to a truly unique and innovative battle system that allows even the most inexperienced D&D players a chance to really get into the action and have fun. 

It's a big game and while it has its glitches the same as most any other game, I appreciate how quick the",1

"As someone who usually skips RPGs and prefers to play RTS games, management sims, MOBAs and first-person shooters, this game has changed me. I haven't been more immersed in a game since I was 11 years old playing Ocarina of Time and I have never been more invested in a story.

At this point in my playthrough, the options available for classes and combat feel infinite. I know that usually in this genre, the beginning feels overwhelming and then as you go on throughout the game you start to understand what's good and what's not and how limited your options are, but I genuinely think that with this game",1

"I missed playing D&D with my friends. It's been a while, and many of us have moved on in life from our little group. Baldur's Gate heavily reminds me of those great, fun days - except I can play it with my friends or by myself. 

I found the rules, characters, story and overall build of the game to be very polished and smooth. Already can see the potential for replay, even though the story is pretty straightforward, the choices you make - from character selection, to which NPCs you choose to group with, to ",1
been having alot of fun with it now if i try to save i get a sync could save and it never goes away from there ive been waiting like 4 hours and i still cant save my flipping game always fun when they break it with the first update,1
I love it and i can't wait to see the next content,1
It's good but let's be honest we all already knew that.,1

Can't wait for the full game if early acces is so good!,1

"The game is super fun, but if you want to play it. I would not recommend it now. 

The game crashes often and we lost many hours of content every single time (Forgot to save) I mean you don't know when it's gonna crash. Autosave doesn't seem to be working in multiplayer??*

"The game just doesn't work for me...

Nothing was really explained.  There's a whole lot of options but none of them really seem to matter.  There's a TON of just running around talking to random people.  Most of the chat options are meaningless, since there's no way to know what they do, are they good, bad?   Do I accept something or not?  I don't know.  Should I do X or Y?  No idea.  Do I go right or left?  No clue.  So you're basically just randomly running around randomly clicking on random things with ",0
"It's unfortunate given how Divinity: Original Sin II felt for me, but at this state, I simply can't recommend the game, and solely because of one, massive flaw.

I'll first go with the positives. The combat system is fun (though I, a guy that never played DnD, found the mechanics confusing) and it does iron out some things I didn't like of DOS:II (you can pickpocket the same NPC more than once here), and it visually looks really nice. The rest is generally satisfactory but I don't have much to say, as it's ",0
"In October the game got into 2 years of early access.
Larian is indeed working hard on the game, fixing bugs, adding some content, changing things around, but nothing major or adressing any of the players concerns ..  but most importantly it doesnt feel like a true BALDURS Gate experience, it feels more like a Larians Gate 3 , or a DOS Gate 3.
The link chain is trash tier (formation), there is no day/night cycle, the game seems barren and dead after finishing each area.
Altho its supposed to be a complete R",1
"      This is honestly one of my new favorite games of all time, and probably will always speak highly of this game, I'm on my second run and have still found SO MUCH MORE NEW CONTENT! There are so many small details that I missed the first time, and I have no doubt I still missed a ton this run. Little choices play a big part in how the story will go, which adds to the freedom this game gives your character. The character customization is very good, both appearance and class wise. The combat is SUPER fun! ",1
"Not perfect, but pretty damn close.",1
"Brilliant game for an Early Access title. Larian's transparency and amazing communication make the experience worth it, but just be aware that this is a VERY unfinished game. What there is of it runs pretty well and looks really good, and there's the makings of a brilliant story-line in here too. The UI is pretty intuitive which is important in a game so packed with features (as is expected of any good 5e conversion - and this is a damn good one). They're constantly releasing updates and patching and fixing",1
"I absolutely adore this game, even if its pre-release and they are still working on fixing bugs and improving/altering features. I've really enjoyed the story and watching it continue. Even with the limited time I've put nearly 800 hours into this game already and will continue to add to it.",1
Gnome,1
Few glitches here and there but amazingly fun to play.,1
"With over 500 hours in early access, it still left me wanting more. I cannot imagine there will be a dip in quality after Act 1. In fact, given the attention to detail in Act 1, I fully expect it to only get better. I am a little bit disappointed with the change to all races given +2/+1 to any stats, as I feel this makes race selection less meaningful, but no biggie.  Can't wait to try out some of the new races and classes, and experiment with multi-classing.",1
Great game a full product is hard to come by nowadays.,1

Pros
- High replayability ( decided to re roll my main character after 1 hour of game play, and thanks to the dice system events unfolded differently made it a different experience )
- Visuals are good
- A true Rpg
- Choices are everywhere !
 
Cons
- A lot of simmilarity with the game Divinity (yes same developer), with some additions, makes you wonder... is it worth it ? because you can buy slightly t",0
Greatest game since Divinity: Original Sin 2.,1
"fun, entertaining and emersing.",1
Very detailed and enjoyable. Beware this is not for the action fans.,1
Amazing story and flexibility for players to go at their own pace and do whatever they want. Looking forward to replaying as a different class and taking different paths.,1
"Great characters, great music, fantastic gameplay, excellent dialogue. I really could go on. Early Access is not without it's bugs or issues but I am so glad I took the plunge and I can easily recommend this experience even at this stage of development",1
Amazing game. You can what you want and there are so many options.,1
"For weeks I knew I'd either love or hate this game.

And now I have my answer. The tutorial...isn't. I was dropped in with a full suite of skills and powers. Nothing explained. I came across items and received no input over their relevance.  No insight over how to move to reach map markers. Or the fact that there are ledges to climb. i walked right into fire, because naturally I'd voluntarily do that. I found that I had to check the entire screen with my cursor to uncover ""items"" that may, or may not have i",0
Still in early access but otherwise very engaging and fun can't wait for the full content.,1
Feature complete at release : largely bug free at release : massive world : pretty art : great story triple A game with a particularly fun interpretation of licenced D&D mechanics.,1
"On the front end, this is going to be a great game. I am however a little miffed as I was not expecting to wait over a year, and still no release date in sight. If they mentioned it at the start of pre-release that it would take this long it sure wasn't clearly stated. I think they should give free downloads of BG 1-2 for anyone that has waited a year or more. I would likely buy some of the DLC if they did. Just saying- 
I owned both of these games but that was before Steam platform and I no longer have acc",1
"Very Gut, but baggi in act 3 nad has 30-40 fps in act tree(only  in circus nad other town)",1

Who let Larian Studios cook?,1
Better than Divinity,1
Early access was well worth the investment and I am really looking forward to the full release next month!,1
The greatest RPG ever made.,1
One of the best games I have played in a long time. I have played EA add still the dev has out done themselves. I have always been a fan of the Baldur's Gate series and I think this game has held up to the Wizards of the Coast and the standerds that have been in prevous games. I really injoy the stories and side content this game has to offer.,1
its dnd crossed with original sin. if you like one of either of those 2 youll enjoy it. so far no game breaking bugs.,1
"lots of love in this one right
 here. i hope to make love to it more",1
"Bruh I didn't even think I liked these types of games, yet this is EASILY game of the year for me. Nothing but respect to the devs. 

Johnny Banger Certified!",1
"I could talk about how as a kid, games like Dragon Age used to make me feel things like awe and wonder while being inspired by what the makers of that game would be able to do with advancing technology in the years to come. I could talk about how I have really felt there has been a lack of titles that have interested me as of late. I could also talk about how this game feels like in many ways what I was excited for all those years ago, or how this feels like the next gen of RPG with its impressive graphics,",1
Easily the greatest RPG I've ever played. Maybe the best game I've ever played.,1
"Updating my review now that the game is released. Full of bugs. There are times when you lose the ability to loot containers sometimes until you restart the game. I have also encountered various traps that have no way out of them and trap you in a room with no exit so you have no choice but to reload your save, which isn't really a great rpg mechanic. I would avoid until on sale as it is hot garbage.

Some of the new characters are cool, but that's all that has improved on release.",0
Meets the high expectations,1
I'll be getting a refund. I bought this early based upon what other people experienced. I was psyched. Fast forward to actual launch and the biggest changes are the removal of racial effects and sex at character creation. Way to shoehorn in an agenda and tainting what should have been a great game.,0
Berserker goes burrrrrr!,1
"16 January 2023:
I played as a Elven Eldridge Knight, a Drow Cleric of Mielikki, a Half-Elf Druid, then a Forest Gnome Bard - and each class and character gave unique twists in quests and dialogue options. It is fantastic as a story, looks beautiful and the combat system is delicious. Astarion doesn't like any of my characters no matter how hard I try and Gale gives me hair envy - I love it!
Fun, beautiful and exactly the adventure I was looking for.

"Idolising degeneracy. 
Most people are playing this game for the wrong reasons.
The difficulty is almost non-existent even on Tactician.
The story is a parody and the characters would be suitable to play in a teenage drama series on Netflix. Yes it's that bad.

But hey! You can have sex with anything that moves and breathes.
Idolising degeneracy.",0

I think its really going to test the limits of what can be done. Can't wait to see for updates, DLCs and mods.... games like this really make me wonder what the future of the gaming community holds.",1
"One of, if not the best RPG of all time. This game dethroned the Mass Effect series as my personal favorite, and it just keeps getting better and better. The Story is amazing, The characters are beyond great, the stories interweave. This game is so beyond detailed it's genre-defining. Add in the fact that this is basically just like playing the TTRPG version of D&D, but in digital form, and this game is easily one of the greatest of all time. This game is a must play!",1
"I think what broke me in the end was the fact that in one boss battle I did about 30 saves, and loaded about 100 times.
Not because the boss was hard, but because of all the bugs in this battle and the cut scene beforehand. I literately started crying at some point. you know what is more cruel than a bad game ? a good game that hooks you but have that 1 thing that makes you crazy.

The story has a few odd things about it, it makes it feel like you are immediately put under time pressure, but there is no obvious timer, and then later it turns out there probably isn't time pressure, maybe. It's a bit odd of a choice for that reason, but otherwise it's pretty interesting. There's also entirely too many ""you ",0

The WORST parts about this game:
-NPC's
-Bland Writing
-Combat
-Ironically, it's lack of game direction

Now that being said the developers really did take criticism to the heart and continued to improve the game and a lot of my concerns have been improved upon.

It's the closest to playing an actual pen and paper DnD campaign that I've seen in a video game.  Looking forward to replaying many times, especially looking forward to doing some runs in co-op mode.

I played the Early Access and had problems with certain glitch/crash bugs.  I can happily say those are at least fixed.  It actually feels fairly polished with only a few janky issues they can probably clear up.  That being said, I actually think I had more fun during Early Access than this garbage.

My biggest gripe here is that every single, even non-dice-roll encounter, will end in ""oh you did everything I asked and did everything right? well now the whole village will try to murder y",0
The further you get into the game the worse the bugs get. This is not a complete game and does not deserve the praise its getting. Wait till its done and do not waste your money. every you find a way past one game breaking bug you bump into another. To add to that once you past act 2 the game can hardly run.,0

There was no warning on Steam that for Mac it is still in early access, so you basically pay 60 euros for early access game that is very buggy, puts you into never ending loops and does not load graphic elements properly.

Come on Larian they have Overwatch for that. Then comes the “body types”. I want to play as a MAN OR WOMAN.

Playing BG3(even in Early Access)bring back my childhood memories of playing TRPGs with my friends and one day dreaming that this could be processed to a more dynamic computer managed game. And there is, Larian made it.
As far as gameplay go, its as immersive as it gets, you get to interact a lot with your environment and your class, really forcing you to think out of the box to manage hard encounters",1

Even other amazing games like Fallout New Vegas can't compare to the sheer magnitude of different decisions and outcomes you can explore in this game. I've only playing DND a few times in my life, but this game almost perfectly matches that feeling. The guys at Larian Studios know what it takes to make art man.

Taking a step back for safety, we lit up the barrels and obliterated Laezel. I then had Karlach pick up the remains of what was once an annoying Gith and the party and I headed out to find a deep dark hole to dump her body into.

OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BALDUR'S RİNG,1
One of the must play games of this generation.,1
"Love the game so far, so many choices and some made me and my boyfriend laugh our asses off. Let's just say...windmill gnome...",1
"Por donde empiezo. El juego es una auténtica basura, no es un Baldur's gate. He jugado mas de 500h en muchas partidas y configuraciones a los antiguos BG y esto no tiene nada que ver con la saga. Es que ni siquiera el sistema de combate tiene algo que ver, pasa de la mítica pausa táctica de los antiguos a un sistema por turnos que corta totalmente el desarrollo del juego. Tiene unos puzzles sencillos y sin gracia y una profundidad mucho menor que los antiguos juegos. Me parece perfecto que hagan un Divinity",0
"Pronouns...

lol

EDIT: Animal sex, even bigger LOL. You know the people behind DnD and this game think Bikini armour is ""Problematic""...but bestiality? That's some diversity right there...",0
"I gave this game a (brief) try and didn't enjoy it. If you have a background in DnD then you'll probably like it. It is definitely true the tabletop game feel, and I was impressed with the depth of mechanics and story telling. But if you like rpg's such as Elden Ring or The Witcher, it's a far step away from those experiences. 

The character customization also felt really lackluster compared to current day standards. Not a deal breaker but surprising and a bit disappointing for the genre/scope.

It's easy ",0

Lovely game,1
That's what I'm talking about! That's why this game is the GOAT; the GOAT!,1
Håt damn!,1
"Did great on the RP aspect, a flourishing world with amazing lore/storytelling and intricate relationships. However, the G aspect is mind-numbingly dull with some seriously clunky mechanics. Wish i could refund!",0
S U P E R B,1
Absolutely amazing story line and graphics.,1
"Easy GOTY 2023 for me. I believe BG3 will be for the 2020's what TES: Skyrim was for the 2010's. The depth, the characters, the music, and the story are all SO GOOD. Everything after the final battle felt a tiny bit rushed...but it was still a remarkable game that I can't wait to replay.",1
Amazing Graphics and the gameplay brings me back to the D&D and Gurps games I used to play when I was young,1
"While it is Early Access, if you've enjoyed the other BG titles, I believe you will like BGIII. I'm only a few hours in and already I'm hooked.",1
Baldur's Gate 3 is the very definition of a gift that keeps giving,1
"I have really been enjoying this game. Great role playing options and alternate story lines (good or evil). The game world is beautiful, interactive, and huge. The voice acting is fantastic, and I like that the game can have some good humor and doesn't take doesn't take itself too seriously. The game is challenging, so save often, and plan out strategy before going into a big battle, even though you end up in them without any warning. So be prepared to backtrack and reload often.
My only gripe, even though ",1
"GOOD
No corporate greed
Full game, full price
No microtransactions
THIS is how games should be made!",1
"The game is average and certainly not as good as professional, authoritative, respected critics describe. I completed the game completely and ended up disappointed and my mood is ruined. The problem is that the first 70% of the game really looks like it's very good and I really enjoyed it, but the last 30% pissed me off every step of the way. I went all the way from love to hate for this game.

"What can i say, one of the best games i ever played ^^

Growing up with titles like Neverwinter nights and Icewind dale, this has to be peak DnD experience. The rolls are annoying but obligatory, the combat is pristine, story is perfect and so are dialogues. i'm in the midst of act II and i don't feel like playing anything else - haven't felt that way about a solo game in years.

I did play the divinity games, wasteland titles or solasta etc but nothing even comes close to the level of quality that this has",1
"amazing that early access ran smooth and now it moves like trash,  so turns out it was my one drive causing my issue",1
"Not only a worthy sequel to a beloved franchise (I still have the collectors edition box of ""Shadows of Amn"") but Larian Studios raises the bar for RPG's *once again*. Don't wait for a sale on this one, it's worth EVERY penny!
Game of the Year contender?! Beyond a doubt!",1
"After years in EA, the game still has game breaking bugs (yes, that's plural) that bricked my 30+ hour savegame. I submitted a bug report and contacted support. No response and no update after a month and 2 patches. At the very least, I expected an acknowledgement or some response that they will look into it.

While I understand this is a complex game, having these kind of game breaking bugs is still unacceptable and making it worse by not replying to bug reports. As such, I cannot recommend this game, in i",0

AAA game. Great story,1
Immersive and stupid amount of options and customizations. Love it,1
"On August 3rd, I heard that the game was getting fully released, so I saved up my money to buy it for my MacOS system (2022 Pro). To my surprise, it's still in early access despite Larian Studios saying that it was fully releasing for PC. No big deal, I'll play for as long as I can and then I'll be able to transfer my progress over to whenever it is released fully for Mac. 

I come to find out that I CAN'T transfer my progress after playing, which I only found out about by going to Larian Studios' website. ",0

This is game is hard to play. And there were no tutorials to help with the basics. Very hard for beginners.,0
"Keep LGBTQ crap out of video games!

For clarification I am not referring to the romance options in the game. That's your choice. I am referring to the fact that at the end of act 2 I was forced into a Lesbian dialogue scene where they make out then discuss how they are gonna have sex later...why? Keep political and gender ideologies out of video games ffs!",0
"as a dnd player, i love being able to see the game come to life. i recommend it to anyone who likes dnd or any rpg game for that matter. plus ur party is literally full of hotties",1
"Enormously disappointing.  

I wanted to like this game so much, but I did not.

The gameplay just feels like a tremendous kluge.  There's no flow.  You jerk from one thing to the next.  Every character I've interacted with had has some sort of attitude problem--which just seems angsty instead of whatever realism they were going for. Movement, in and out of combat, feels awkward.  The camera doesn't let you see far enough.

I wish I hadn't tried so hard to like it--I passed the return window.",0
i like it but i do need a bit better laptop to play the game but what i played of i like it a lot,1

Game is really good but the fps is insanely bad in act 3 once you get to the lower city my pc drops to sub 10 fps with a rtx 3070,0
"The game would be a perfect 10/10 but it has one huge glaring flaw that will ruin that game for most people...too many British people. Which automatically drops the game to only a measly 4/10, besides that its great.",1
"Labour of love. 
Can you remember the last time you went to bed at 4 in the morning and still couldn't fall asleep because you needed to know what would happen next? Neither did I before this came out
Awesome storytelling, great combat system, choices feel like they actually matter and it doesn't hurt that the graphics are gorgeous. 
I cannot wait to see how this will grow in the future
10/10 would recommend again",1
Good ass game,1
Barely played it so far but have already had more fun than what I did in all of D4. I believe this will trump all other games that have been released in the past 5 years. Last game that was released this good was Elden Ring. Please force other publishers to make this type of complete game a standard as I don't trust AAA games when they get released.,1
"This is everything i wanted and more minus the bugs. I'm going to try and stay spoiler free but will mention a few enemy types and Char types without trying to spoil the locations and npc names. I am a big dnd nerd so bios is here just a forewarning on my opinion.

Graphics and sound 10/10
Stunning i dont know what else to say about visuals. Sound is also strong I literally nerdgasmed at the sound eldritch blast made when i fired it the first time.

the best rpg i have played so far. Wp to the devs,1
This game is so freaking sick,1
the closest you'll get to playing d&d in a video game as you can get,1
This game only has smashable characters,1
Great game! Almost like a real DnD Session but with slightly less arguements,1
Good representation of D&D. Dialogue and story is decent. Combat is turn style like the table top game. The game still has a few bugs but its not bad for a beta at all.,1
I am absolutely loving this game.  Played through early access twice already.  Working on a 3rd play through now. I can't wait for it to be finished!,1
"Honestly this is probably the most tried, and true D&D video game out there. Especially speaking as someone who is almost always DM for campaigns IRL, it feels extremely nice to be the player. The game does have its bugs, but considering the fact it's early access, it's extremely easy to look past them. If you find a bug that annoys you, report it. It's the easiest way to make the game much more fun for everyone. But other than bugs this game has an extraordinarily amount of content for early access. I've n",1
"tiddies and dcks, good game",1
Love D&D and this game is a great representation of D&D with all the storytelling/choices and consequences that can occur.  Highly recommend,1
Amazing experience (solo and coop).  Just keep finding more hidden gems in the world and interactions.,1
"It's still in early access, and I have a feeling it will be a long time before we see a polished product. It has a ton of interface issues, and it's prone to a lot of random crashes. All in all technically, while def playable it's a janky mess. Yet, I don't regret buying it for a single moment. I'm 110+ hours in, with 3 different classes, and enjoying the hell out of it. 
Pros: Story, graphics, intuitive UI, voiceacting is great, it's a great successor to the series. If you're a fan of D&D it's a must play.",1
BG3 is out of pay-for-alpha! Pretty good so far,1
"It's D&D 5th Edition in video game format, with both its strengths and some of its flaws. 

This is probably one of the best RPG experiences Larian is capable of producing. 100% worth the cost of entry. Hell, buy the Deluxe Edition too. I guarantee it's worth it if you're a massive fan for RPG's done in this classic style.",1

It's got a great story.
it's chill to play. 
You can play it alone or with others. 
It's got great replayability as your choices affect outcomes.

It's just a great game all around. GOTY? Yes!",1
"Larian have really outdone themselves. I've played DOS1 and DOS2. Both were carefully and lovingly crafted RPGs that I sank WAY too many hours into due to just the sheer amount and quality of options, content, and their stories. Larian really took all of that love and passion for the RPG genre and created something that has shaken the gaming community from us players to the money grubbing despots at the top of AAA companies. I don't think for a second I'm exaggerating when I say that.",1
"One of the best games both in the genre and in general. Insane attention to detail, a dozen different ways to approach each problem, most of which you will not experience or even think about in a single playthrough. Interesting characters and story, very well crafted and packed locations.",1

It's now mandatory for me since I have done all the major questlines and need to progress with this quest to finish the game, but I am stuck in a dead end. Reddit and",0
Great story line and multiple ending depending on your choices. Shadow heart is hard to please. Religion is her only love... overall leave shadow heart alone and find other venues. Great game going to work on my second play through. I don't normally play through a game multiple times. Great job!,1

Very open, and not afraid to let you break things (mechanics wise), since they aren't trying to sell you anything after you buy the game. Really hard to overstate how much better this makes the game feel. All ready looking forward to my second play through.",1
goofy ah dnd game,1
"so far looks like its going to be fun, but you can tell a lot of development is going to be needed. textures not loading, music and sound not loading in, choppy or poor animations. will have to fiddle with settings a bit but theres jank regardless. still much potential. unless you are wanting to support the devs or are happy to experience the game in a lesser state i wouldnt recommend. tho i will add ive barley played anything of it yet.",0

Almost through act 1 on 4 different campaigns,1
Multiplayer literally does not work. Latest patch removed the only band-aid fix which involved launching two copies of the game and joining your own lobby. Don't buy it if you plan on playing with anyone.,0

"this game made me wonder if i'm too old for video games
not because of the difficulty or the gameplay, those are okay i guess

I originally started with a yes to recommend this game.  However when I started to think why I would recommend this game I realized I couldn't think a good reason.  The community around this game thinks for some reason any constructive criticism about your characters development is LGBT+ hate.

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an absolute masterpiece! With 141 hours of gameplay and still going strong, this game has captivated me like no other. Its rich storytelling, immersive world, and complex characters have kept me hooked, and the attention to detail is simply astounding.

I think it's not bad if you ever managed to cope with DnD implementation in video games. Which is clearly not my case. Aside from that the biggest issue that has been driven me mad is dialogs cutscenes.

Yet, after downloading for nearly 2 hours, when I opened the game, it clearly stated in the upper right hand corner of the screen, that it is an early access version.  I played less than 2 hours, and decided to return the game for a refund.  I consider not labeling this on the product page as early access as dishonest. Buyer beware.",0

This was my first CRPG. I recently started playing tabletop dungeons and dragons with some friends, but I found myself having a hard time understanding what was going on and visualizing things.

This is the Best cRPG you will ever find in decade.,1
"Usually i would recommend this game without second thoughts. The story is rich (from what i saw so far), the characters are unique and funny and there is almost no limit to what u can do. But i still have to say no, because the crashes u get are fricking outrageous. Imagine you're in a boss fight, almost done with all of them and then BOOM, crash. I cant think of anything more infuriating. Until they fix those crashes and bugs, i would maybe wait a week or two.",0
"I love the game! It has great DnD lore, great variability, really nice cutscenes and by far the best is in my opinion is the posibility to choose from a plethora of solutions, dialogue options and they all have consequences.
The graphics are awesome and as an avid DnD player i really like how Larian studios implemented DnD rules. It is mostly great, it did nerf sorcerer and boost barbarian and paladin a bit, but overall great.
It resembles Divinity a lot, but manages to be distinctly original, mostly thanks",1
I like playing dnd 5e because you feel powerful I've run many games for friends and family and this game losses me with what the expect you to deal with with the gear and spells you are given.,0

"An incredibly slow and boring experience with decent graphics and grating design choices.

Constant save-scumming with unreasonably long load times.  Waiting for your turn through 80% of combat encounters, especially in multiplayer.  Tons of unnecessary inventory management with a terrible UI.  None of these things are fun, and the mocap can't make up for how frustrating it is to play.",0

Culture note: The devs who talked smack should reorient their mindset and strive to do better, to constantly compete with better products over time, as opposed to offering condemnation for a studio that worked hard for a long time to release a superior product. As a consumer, I am nothing but stoked to invest countless hours ",1
Too complicated.,0
This game is very exciting and wonderful to play with friends and with your partner. I highly recommend this game to people who really enjoy DND. :),1
Fix the autosave! i cant even say how many times ive played for 20 minutes and died. Sure it has bugs that can be attributed to early access but nothing makes me want to never touch the game again more than playing the same 30 minutes 3 or 4 times.,0

It's worth your time and money.",1

"Act 1: Amazing
Act 2: Great
Act 3: Meh

You can tell the game was rushed near the end. Still an awesome experience overall. Hopefully Larian can fine tune the final act. Quite a few bugs and some of the quests felt mediocre compared to the first 2/3rds of the game. If you have the patience, I recommend waiting 1-2 years for the definitive edition when (hopefully) the final act will be up to par with the rest of the game.",1

"I'm giving this game a thumbs up even though I hate it. Two reasons for that: I appreciate the ethics of the developers and want to support that, firstly. And second, the reason I hate it is I'm just NOT into this type of game anymore.

This is a hardcore old-school RPG, and it seems to cater to fans of DnD particularly in a big way. I don't know, I don't play DnD, but I was constantly confused about EVERYTHING so that must be what's up. Now, it seems to me if you like those kinda things this is an absolute",1

I saved Baldur's gate but was rejected my hot githyanki gf for becoming a squid boi.

would sell my soul coin for this game,1
Honestly had way too much fun just going in by the EA and had many many stories and characters made which I have shared with friends both old and new ones. All of those wonderful encounters were inspired and because of this game. The crew deserves a well deserved rest and to treat themselves to a fancy vacation after this!!!,1

Is fun.  They finally finished it.  You can have my money, I guess you guys do care.  Go buy this game, you can stop waiting.  A good investment.  I feel like it was money well spent.

How's that?  I'll admit when I'm wrong.",0

"Avoid at all cost if lack of luck is frustrating for you. If you spend an entire fight with a 70+% hit rate and miss every hit you're gonna hate it.

Also you better get ready to save scum a lot of stuff. Because instant death traps seems to be the kind of difficulty this game enjoys. So if you like jumping on a ledge then finding out with a successful roll that there's an explosive mushroom there only way too late, then seeing it explode and push you into the chasm.

Tons of story, plenty of side quests, and another great thing you dont always feel like your getting side tracked when you are doing the smaller stuff.

I have no idea what I'm doing and progressing and finding quests is very tedious.

There is no closure or proper ending, many companion quests glitch out and are broken beyond repair, even some main quests just... don't respond.

Divinity original sin1 - shipwrecks and waters in the beginning!
Div2 - shipwrecks and waters in the beginning!!
Div3:BG - shipwrecks and water in the beginning!!!
Some love for the broken ships and beaches right there lol. Maybe some past life trauma for writers team or Swen Vincke I dunno.

Anyways, why this game is not Baldurs Gate successor?
Tuned up engine taken from other franchise(DoS) and spiced up with 5e rules.
Bad story tel",0
love the great story line and game play would recommend to all my gaming friends,1
It's d&d as a game and it's absolutely amazing,1
great game really love it but the crashing is just not ok for this price tag and 3 years of early access,1
"87 hours and three years of EA, I still haven't gotten out of act one. Reccomended!",1
I would say for a D&D game it's a very good game and lots of fun and u should give it a shot and there's a lot to do even in the early access and the customization is pretty good just wish there were more faces or just a slide like in ESO/ Elder scrolls online and that's really it and maybe a body slider just cuz i would like to be able to look like a old man who is retired or a solder who has a drinking habit and has a pot belly because of it but this just for me and its not really needed but those few new,1
"Im giving this a positive review, because it's one of the best games i've ever played.

DON'T BUY IT YET!!
 
You can only play the first act (about 20 hours) of the game. I was not aware of this and felt pretty heartbroken that I could'nt continue with  the character i had gotten invested in.

This game will be amazing, but do yourself a favor and be patient. 

Buy it when it's done.

EDIT:

THE GAME IS DONE SO GO NUTS!!!

EDIT 2:

After beating the game, I realise that I was wrong to call this game amazing",1
"Great game, feels like a sequel to both Divinity Original Sin 2 and Baldur's Gate 2.",1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is an absolute masterpiece that encapsulates the essence of epic storytelling, strategic gameplay, and immersive fantasy worlds. From the moment I started playing, I was drawn into a realm of magic, mystery, and adventure that I simply couldn't escape.

The game's attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking. The intricate design of characters, landscapes, and creatures is a testament to the developers' commitment to creating a visually stunning universe. Each location, from bustling",1
best game that came out last 23 years,1
Great game with lots of options and replay ability. Better with friends. Waited a long time for this game and it was worth it.,1
"The official Mac release is a disaster!

My save files of the pre release version are all unusable with the official release, wasting so many hours of my play.

I cannot use a Xbox controller, because it will split the screen and go to local coop mode, although there is only one controller connected.

Please fix all the stupid game breaking bugs before release or just let me play the old version.",0
"I don't understand at what point this is supposed to become fun.

Combat is annoyingly slow while simultaneously overly tedious, especially if you co-op with other people.  It turns the entire game into an extra large pile of sitting with your thumb jammed far up your butt.

Waste of $60.  Waste of development.  Hopefully the refund goes through even after 4 hours - between character creation and the absurd number of cutscenes, I think I only moved around on my own for about 20 minutes.

Refund went through",0
"Baldur's Gate 3 has so far proven to be an excellent investment for the Turn based Role  playing gamer within. Graphically excelling compared to most modern games, it proves to be a true to heart D&D experience, and nothing really comes close to the level of down to earth this game has. The story so far reveals plenty of potential and the overall feeling is the most genuine ""Single Player"" D&D experience you can get. Everything in this game feels like it was designed with both Multiplayer AND Single Player ",1
Incredibly immersive,1
"Excellent game, been playing since beta. Probably the best game I've ever played.",1
"Truly a masterpiece of writing and gameplay, just what I expected from Larian Studios after Divinity Original Sin 2. The flow of combat, the companions, and the world around you just goes together perfectly. It really feels like a Dungeons and Dragons session in video game form, in the best way.",1
"-10/10 

Can't make Boo go squeak. It is no Baldur's Gate game. it is a LIE.",0
"Played the game in Early Access when it first started, played a bit of the next few patches, then left it alone so I wouldn't burn out on the first area.

I've almost gotten to the point the early access finished, and I have to say the amount of polish and consideration that has gone into almost every aspect of this game is truly mind-blowing.

It really feels like playing D&D with a DM who has been working on their own homebrew rules and WAY over prepared. And it is awesome. Every encounter has something i",1
"Playing split screen it's unplayable, unfortunately. Was excited to play with a friend locally, but as soon as we get to the second area (basically out of the tutorial), it crashes after a few minutes of play when playing with low capped FPS and low graphic settings.

Just posting this because the game is drowned in praise and very few people are actually warning fellow gamers of what they are getting into here. Be warned that this is a long read and is likelly to gather a lot of clown awards for attempting to relay the hard truth.

"This is a very good game, sure its got some bugs but Larian is doing a very good job at fixing them. It took 145 hours for me to finish my first playthrough and I'm about to start a second. Worth every penny spent would totally recommend people to buy it. And if that isn't reason enough you can also pet a dog.",1
Honestly a fun game but some of the mechanics frankly make no sense and you just die instantly.,0
IT IS SO GOOD IT HAS TO BE GOTY THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT RN,1
"I can already tell this is going to be one of the best dnd games of all time. the combat is fantastic as well as the story so far. however with it being $60 I cannot recomend anyone to get it right now with the sate that it is in. it has already hard crashed on me and the game feels so unstable Im always thinking it could crash at any point.

I suggest to everyone to wait until the bugs have been ironed out, cause without the bugs this game is easily worth $60, to me at least.",1
i made whoopee with astarion,1
"currently a buggy mess, best to wait until its actual release",0
Yeah is pretty good,1
"Love the graphics and the treatment of the AD&D IP.  I haven't gotten too far into the story yet, but it seems great so far!",1
"Still some bugs, that usually get fixed at restart, but otherwise a great experience. 

It remind me of Neverwinter Nights 1 a lot and I am quite fond of that game,",1
Beautiful visuals and excellent gameplay. Love this turn-based game and the ability to utilize the environmental elements available.,1
Everything I ever wanted in an RPG and then some. Game of the year for sure,1
Game keeps crashing at the end of a cut scene. Every single time - so can no longer progress the game.,0
"Fantastic game! Has a great story, its fun with friends, I enjoy the gameplay and the impact of my choices being so important.",1

THIS GAME IS FIRE,1
It has Karlach.,1

Act 3 is fucking unplayable
still not finished after patch 4&5",0

The worst part about this game is waiting for your friends to finish it so you can actually talk to them about it.",1

"Only seventeen hours in so far, but I love it. No surprise there, given I'm a Larian Studios fan girl. Looking forward to continuing my adventure with my friends. Highly recommended if you enjoy games like Divinity Original Sin 1/2, Pillars of Eternity 1/2, Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous and the like.

Revised: Over thirty hours in now. Still loving it.",1
This game is straight up tits.,1
you can sex mind flayer,1
only playd in early acess. The game is amazing and a must buy for rpg lovers.,1
"Mind blowing game, really deep story, interactions actually have a butterfly effect, the only two games that got me reading and focusing on all the dialog (divinity original sin 2, BG3), element interactions make sense, you can fight smart not just spamming the same ability, battle strategy is important, and knowing your character abilities and skills will push you so far in the game",1
"Got stuck IN a door of a cage in the first act)) In truth I was just passing by and now I can't go in or out. 
In overall the game is pretty laggy.",0
"As an avid fan of role-playing games, I approached Baldur's Gate 3 with high expectations, and I'm thrilled to say it not only met but exceeded them in every way. Larian Studios has outdone themselves, crafting a game that's both a love letter to classic RPGs and a bold step forward in the genre.

From the moment you start, you're drawn into a richly detailed world, brimming with lore and mystery. The game's story is a masterclass in narrative design, weaving intricate plot threads with a cast of characters",1
"I have played nothing else since it's release. Not tempted to play anything else ever again. I'll just keep making characters and be happy, thank you.",1
"Now the game has been released, I thought it was a good time to visit it fully, after not wanting to ruin the full experience for myself after purchasing this way back... unfortunately, I managed to have 3 game breaking bugs within the first couple of hours, having to restart the game repeatedly does not make for a fun experience... doesn't seem ready for release.",0
Slayed,1
It's simple. You can pet the dog so it's a 10/10. Agree?,1
i have a tadpole in my brain. the game is cool too,1
"The game would be a no-pun-intended ABSOLUTE recommendation if I were going purely by the first two acts, which are by all accounts phenomenal and some of the best experiences I've had in an RPG in recent memories. However, this leads up to an act 3 that falls apart at the seams due to bugged companion interactions, missing cutscenes, and dialogue, amongst other things that can't be fixed by a simple reload or restart. If someone were to ask me if they should buy the game, I'd say wait till they've dropped ",0
Let me level up already.,1

Game of the decade without a doubt.,1
One of the best games I've ever played. A perfect adaption of DnD to gaming and wow is it beautiful.,1
"An outstanding achievement. 

A major step-up from the last Divinity game in all major areas, even if some small frustrations from that are still present here (mostly UI and camera related, honestly). Some of the best companions I've ever encountered in a RPG and with, by far, the best presentation I've ever seen in a CRPG. Voice acting and animations are absolutely top notch and really bring the game to life.  The D&D ruleset also makes the combat a lot more enjoyable than it was in Divinity and forces Lar",1
"Stealth just doesn't work in this game. Because they have you roll stealth every time eyes pass over you, rather than once per round per creature, a single creature can attempt to detect you several times without using any actions just by rotating in place, which they do to an annoying extent.",0
"Don't let the hours fool you I looked up spoilers for act 3 and the endings. What a lazy piece of shit endings. I am NOT playing through a gigantic as hell game like this to get screwed by those terrible endings. Larian has scammed me TWICE NOW. They claimed 17,000 endings we got 2.5 yes we have gotten LESS endings than Mass Effect 3 and they make less sense and are complete asspulls. I will NEVER pirate a Larian game ever again what a complete scam artist studio.",0
"amazing game 

pls give mommy karlach better endings :(",1
im  a slut for games like this and dragonage,1
Loving it so far! Really te best RPG experience i ever had,1
"Exceptional game

runs well, looks amazing and if you were ever looking for a video game version of the tabletop D&D experience, this is it",1
"It runs like shit. Early access, yes. Too early access. Wait until later. Uninstalling. 

edit: the game ran a lot smoother, but i can't wrap my head around the dev's choices. i'm level 3 and the main quest is to find a patrol. the patrol is level 5 and it's an automatic fight. i am getting wrecked. how are we supposed to avoid these situations? this is a game that will have you sink in 10's of hours only to let you mess it up. play this game with a walk through.",0
"Awesome game, never played one like this. Pretty sure I only understand about 10% of the game play but love it so far!",1
Best dnd game in years!,1
"the 3+ year wait for this game paid off.
Theeeee greatest pc rpg.",1
May or may not be obsessed with this game lol,1
"This new Baldur's Gate feels more like D&D than the previous games. 
For example in one encounter I took a book out of my backpack and threw it at an enemy hitting him with a critical and then I ran up and stabbed him with the knife in my off hand killing him. 
Something about yeeting a dictionary into a dudes face just feels very D&D to me.",1
"True to D&D table-top. Turn based, so I know exactly what I did wrong and why my party is all burning!",1
"Actually just the best game out there. So much content, so many different outcomes, potential for a different ending every play through. Definite GOTY quality.",1
"     About to finish my first play through. This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. It is very hard to keep me into a game constantly without feeling a repeating burnout from lack of content. This game offers so much content, and it is entirely playable multiple times without things feeling boring or repetitive. The game also does not push you towards one side or the other. You can have a more ""evil"" play through without too much push back from a lack of a story line there. It also balances out",1
Have to use brain cells to pass most of these challenges.,1
"personally not a fan of turn based games, but this game is so amazing that I spent 24 hours on this game within 3 days",1
Great game. some minor problems but that might be due to my older hardware. and even then it runs great on medium on my 970 so far (act 2),1
Beastiality. There is a level of sexual deviancy and degeneracy that I won't condone. I hope this game is modified before official launch to delete this content. I hope Larian fix it or go bankrupt. That is some truly evil stuff.,0
I haven't had a game hold my attention in a vice grip like this in a while,1
"I am going to start by saying something bold; Balder's Gate 3 is possibly the best video game ever created. The bar has been raised so high that I cannot imagine other large studios even knowing how to compete. This game is everything you would want in a video game. There is blood, gore, and violence; hot characters with depth and personality; branching story arcs with choices that make it feel like it's an adventure you are part of; and just beautiful atmosphere and environments that weave every details to",1
"The story is great and so are many of the characters. The gameplay is also solid but I won't recommend buying it until more bugs has been fixed. So goddamn many bugs!

1. Playing as Gale you cannot consume magical items. = You cannot progress your own background story. 
2. Auto save is hit and miss, meaning if you don't actively save often you'll lose up to half an hour of game time if not more. 
3. Combat can have your character unable to end turn, forcing you to reload an earlier save. 
4. Dialogue and cu",0
"Have you ever played a game and within the first hour or two been ""Holy Balls, I love this. This is amazing, this is a fucking masterpiece. I never want it to end!"" 

Thats BG3. 
Good luck with the addiction.",1
"The Barbie dress up game and Astarion dating sim part is 11/10
The rest of the game (if you like dnd) is phenomenal but doesn't have as much barbie dress up so 7/10",1
Really fun haha,1
"So much fun! In depth story, tons of replay ability! 10/10!",1
As a DM for multiple 5e campaigns this is by far the best D&D video game ever brought out and is a perfect way to introduce D&D to new players,1
Salty Blizzard employees made me buy this. No regrets. None.,1
Need a supercomputer or a newer console i guess. Not going to pay a few thousand to play this one game thanks.,0
I wish this game actually worked.,0
First game I have ever left a review for. This game is a true masterpiece. Larian Studios do not need to say they are truly passionate about this project; the proof is shown within the exceptional gameplay and story-telling that is Baldur's Gate 3. If you are even considering buying this game...Do It.,1
Overrated waste of time.,0
"I am saying this with an honest heart and this is my opinion, BG3 isn't that great yet... it is still far too buggy has poor optimisation and overall isn't fun to play with friends its either they have a bad connection that will have you disconnect multiple times or its servers aren't working correctly, it has also had me control my friends character when they are the host, overall solo experience is fine zero issues but the multiplayer dear god is it a mess if you are getting this game to play with other k",0
"This game was a total nightmare. One of the most frustrating games I've ever played. I've beat it twice, but not at all ready for release. Starting with the point & click interface. When using WASD , it gets hung up quite frequently and game has to be restarted. This was one of the most annoying things about this game was the movement. With all the other glitches, it is nowhere ready for release and is a waste of money. Especially the Baldur's Gate I, and Baldur's Gate II. The screen and graphics are so bad",0
"Combat is extremely boring, tedious and frustrating. Click, miss, end turn, click, miss, end turn, click, miss, end turn. Most spells are useless. If you hit your hold person the target will save. If he doesn't save someone else will sneeze on you wizard and he will lose concentration. If you cast some other spell he will lose concentration.

Party members are to varying degrees horrendous offences. Horny high school satanist goth gf who complains about people not tolerating her religion which is about endi",0
Incredible RPG filled with meaningful choices and fun and interesting combat and classes.,1

Good game with a couple of bugs. Lots of fun with friends. Worth buying.,1

Get a quick rough bite right now or wait for the full thing to come out fresh from the oven in about a year -- BG3 is NOT going to disappoint you.",1

Of all games that charge full price - finally one worth the cost of admission. May the developers thrive and continue on this trend.,1
Love it I'm a total DnD nerd now,1
"It's good.  Expensive, but worth the price for the full game.

The EA product is a little rough around the edges.  Even the content you can access is not fully complete.  I can say that I did literally everything possible and went everywhere you can in the 50 hours I played the first EA build.  Characters are capped at level 4, and you don't get any additional experience once you hit that cap (I would have surely made it many levels above that just based on what I was able to do).

For me, the game systems ",1
Do not purchase this hot pile of ye ye sauce,0
"I'm really not happy about wasting the money on this early access trash. Not really my genre and there are no tutorials in-game to help. 

Also be sure to save the game if you do waste your money on it.

The auto save feature is non-existent or incomplete... and you can be killed by just bout any random shit.

I'm not even sure what else I have to say about it right now since I'm so miffed about the wasted time and money.",0
This is a masterpiece and the game of the decade. Change my mind,1
it's D&D but.... you don't need friends! No seriously I've had trouble playing games more than 5-10 hours before I drop them. then this game came and I couldn't stop playing!,1
"It's a bit of a rip off, no? I loved their previous games but maybe the big name executives are preventing them from making a decent game? Although their previous games weren't exactly without glitches either. Too much math.",0
This does not feel like Dungeons and Dragons to me.  I don't feel like I'm doing anything heroic.  I feel like I'm being led around to slaughter innocent people.  The interface is the most awkward I've ever seen.  It's constantly doing things I don't want.  The PCs with you (are they all evil?) tend to walk through fire for no reason when there are better paths.  So is so much wrong with this game.  I hope it's fixed by the time they really release it.  It still feels like an Alpha version.  I want my money,0

"Game is pretty much the best game on the market right now for RPGs. So much real freedom of choice to do pretty much whatever you can think of and there is coding and voice lines and consequences pretty much for anything good or bad you do.

Even from the start the game is very glitchy and on top of that I have had to go back on saves because half the time everything you have done or things you didn't do respawn. Eventually the game gets to the point to where you can't save anymore and I have went back and recreated and started from the start multiple times. It doesn't seem l,0

EDIT: I'm using this space to ask for a Microsoft Store release because it's the only way to give feedback that actually get's seen by the team. I'm stoked by the fact that Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2 are available on Microsoft Store but this released",0

Only downsides I have had includes a couple bugs and glitches that impacted lots of things. I do believe these will be fixed in time though.

I've waited 2 decades for Baldur's Gate 3 and refrained from diving into the EA so as not to spoil the experience by bugs and incompleteness. At release I told myself to wait a couple of months still, out of, well, the same reasons pretty much.

I haven't played previous Baldur's Gate titles, so I can't speak to the continuity of the series, but coming in as a new player I really have enjoyed the story and characters introduced so far. Combat can definitely be challenging, but I enjoy it, and coming from playing Divinity Original Sin 2, I'm used to having to do the occasional quick load.

I've seen a lot of bugs and the quantity and quality of content is far less good then the first act. But I know this game will be fixed and they are already adding new content.

Baldurs Gate 3 at the time of this review is in early access. Keep this in mind.

Yes the game has its bugs, yes it has some awkward camera angles (to say the least), as well as other things I have no doubt you have read elsewhere here in the reviews or somewhere else across your world wide web.

- Got to a point when camping resulted in random companions attacking you who are not in your group in your own camp!

"There's nothing particulary special about this game that sets it apart - everything has been done before, except Baldur's Gate 3 does it all so great. It's like they cherry-picked the best things and made into something glorious. In fact, they made it so well and packed it into a reasonably priced package that the gaming megacorp ""experts"" are complaining BG3 is ""too good"" (you know a game is worth it when EA, Ubisoft and Blizzard/Activision complain that they can't continue churning out their cookie-cutter",1
"It pains me to leave a negative review for such a great game but hear me out.

Yes, this game offers a lot and even changes the industry in a good way. It lacks one thing so important that ruins everything else for me though - stability and performance. I'll have you know that i played this game on multiple different platforms (on a Steam Deck and on a PC). Even though this game does not offer from any stability problems on the Steam Deck - it was a hell to play on a fairly good PC setup with RTX 3070 GPU.

I am a diehard fan of 3.5/Pathfinder which explains my disdain for 4e and 5e. I can see the taint of 5e on Baldur's Gate 3; feats and skills are too important a part of my D&D experience.

I've ran into a bug that they apparently know about, where a boss is supposed to spawn, and doesn't. This means my party is stuck in a dungeon with no ability to leave and losing me about 2 1/2 hours of playtime.

- So much of every interaction is governed by a high degree of randomness that reloads are very frequent. But each reload takes 30 seconds. Both the large number of arbitrary fails and the long wait to try again break immersion and are generally frustrating.

All those different ways of completing a task and the game handling it correctly.

The game is beautiful if you have the rig to run it on ultra. The aesthetics are generally pretty okay.

There are bugs and there are things that needs an improvement of course.. but considering the condition it is.. it gives a very nice feeling of what it will become. Storywise it's well written. The combat system isn't a hundred percent D&D but quite a mix with the Larian one you may know from playing D:OS2. 
Played the first chapter three times now and in my opinion it's getting a brilliant title of the series. As long you",1
"Closest example of what playing D&D is like IRL. The game is what you make it, silly, serious, strange. Dark Urge is intense, but you have agency of choice.

Highly recommend!!",1
"Obviously a phenomenal game, but downvoting due to the poor communication around the Mac release date. I've had the game sitting in my library for over a month now, unplayable due to the early access condition.",0
"I mean, c'mon. This is an S tier game.",1
"My friend gifted me this game for my birthday. I didn't know what to expect but i absolutely love it!! The Story is phenominal, the graphics are amazing, and the game-play is insane.",1
It has been a true pleasure to learn the combat system and experience the deep storytelling in Baldur's Gate 3. I look forward to experiencing the full gameplay.,1
"Awesome game, very enjoyable to play.",1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is the pinnacle of high art choose-your-own-adventures. It does as good a job as I can imagine on replicating the choice and playstyles of the pen and paper original. The attention to detail is unparalleled; almost every item in the game world can be manipulated in some way, and can be inspected for more details. I appreciate the variety of choice the player is given, from being a shining pauldron of justice, lifting your shoulder to the air, or a simpleton, or a jackass, or a thief, or a ma",1
I usual playthrough a game once after that my adhd kicks in full bore and time to move onto something else. However I'm on my third playthrough planning my fourth due to honor mode and still can't seems to stop playing. Truly game of the year.,1
"I bought this with the intention of having a quick go just to see how it was coming along the maybe dip in  a couple of times before launch just to see how it was progressing. Almost 90 hours later I swear I only meant to play a couple of hours honest, it's just there's so much to do and so many ways to do it. Buy it if you only spend an hour or just under 2 you can refund it go on I dare you. £49.99 is a lot for most games but not this one well done Larian.",1
a modern masterpiece - as good as video games get,1
If you like dnd its a must buy,1
"This game is beautiful and I will be holding this as a new standard for AAA company's.

Breath of fresh air. A complete game with no mirco-transactions or half finished bs.",1
Missed back to back 85% chance rolls. Code issue?,0
"This has to be the most over hyped game that I've ever played. It's boring, clunky, confusing and tedious. I would rather give me money to the soulless developers at EA and get the same $60 roster update",0
"Best RPG since Skyrim. Haven’t finished it yet, but likely surpasses it. Devs are great too.",1
When they fix the rng of the game ill give a good review but 90% of your rolls failing is ridiculous. Picture your worst rolls in D&D history and thats this game 100% of the time,0
"Cannot recommend at this time. I play split screen multiplayer, and it's buggy to the point of being time-wasting. Each patch has fixed a score of bugs, only to introduce more, and at this time I have not been able to play for more than ~20 minutes without a game-breaking bug requiring that I quit and reload.",0
"As a very old D&D player who has not played since 2nd Edition and someone who played the previous two BG titles extensively all I can say is that from a nostalgia perspective it is amazing. From a gaming perspective its depth and detail is fantastic, choices that are meaningful, amazing voice acted cut scenes and an interesting story all lead to an immersive experience.

It is the first game in a long time I have not researched details and am playing it blind because it has inspired me not to play it that w",1
Great D&D style gameplay with options for purists and non-purists alike. Looking forward to full game!,1
best game ive ever played hands down,1
Act 3 is more powerful then the absolute.,0
"Great game, Disliked the game the first 15 hours but at the time you keep progressing you get the hang of it. What it needs is a great bug update cause there are bugs like dead teammates unable to be revivify and the teammates stop following you for no reason.",1
"Buena jugabilidad, buena historia",1
best game i have played in years. and i don't usually play this type of game ether,1
Muscle Mommy Demon GF 🤤,1
SNeak Attk,1
Loads of fun!,1
"bought this game upon first reealease, waited years to finally play the full version. ""failed to load menu"". kind of retarded shit is that? pay $60 for a game and have to go through the 9 circles of hell just to play it. fucking stupid",0
Still way too buggy and unpolished.,0
Cannot believe I am only in Act 1 I think? Overall great game and have yet to be close to finishing.,1
Now it is amazing!,1
"Updated Review: Really deep and enjoyable game ruined by dozens of buggy sequence breaks by the end. 200 hours of careful choices reduced to random nonsense as the game yells at me for doing things I never did. Ruined the ""campaign"" feeling.

Most upsetting, my romance character bugged out and skipped the ending of our relationship. After hours of trying to get around the bugs, I gave up with a broken spirit.

This game is amazing but it was not ready to launch.",0
man i love racism,1
"Like the tabletop version of D&D 5E, except even more streamlined and antisocial. Now you can play by your self and save scum like a b*tch",1
"Excellent RPG    Reminds me of playing Starwars: KOTOR but with all the fun of DND.  Complete with dice-rolls to ruin your day and make no 2 encounters the same. What you choose in chat is VERY important and makes no 2 play troughs the same.  I'm more of a fan of games like ""the Witcher 3"" and Diablo 4, but this makes crossing over into RPG seamless  and honestly refreshing.  So far, the play style doesn't feel repetitive and i'm loving the story driven aspects.  Recommend!",1
"If you need my endorsement to play this game, you have been living in the Underdark too long.",1
you can kill everyone :D,1
Amazing game. THIS is the new benchmark for game quality on a major companies release.,1
">can't romance goblins
lame",1
Literally game of the year and probably game of the decade.,1
" Not for me, great production values though.",0
"First impression is this is just a reskin of Divinity 2 with Dragon Age interactions with characters and, well.....that's what it is.  The start of the game even has the same idea. Start as a prisoner on a ship, something happens, ship is destroyed but you're saved mysteriously, wake up on a beach and make your way toward town to find a way to remove the parasite (godwoken collar)

Within the first 30 seconds of having control of my character I tripped into some fire and burned to death (lol). After reloadi",1
"The other reviews will be more indepth, but this game is great!",1
"This game is fantastic. If you're on the fence, just get it.",1
It's D&D: The Video Game,1
"Fastest 50 hours of playtime ever.  Might feel a bit slow sometimes in terms of UX and theres the occasional bug on narrative moments, but this game is fantastic",1
"First time ever playing this style of game. BIG Zelda fan here, but this game is sooo cool!!! I am not a keyboard player but controller is great!!",1
"More than 30 hours in and I have barely finished the 1st act. This is the first game in a while that I have not sped through because every single quest is genuinely interesting. At least the ones that I have done so far. Having never played a CRPG before, I can't recommend this enough to anybody that is even remotely curious about Balder's Gate.",1
"Love it! Scratches that D&D itch since my irl campaign is still waiting for its first session (it's been months!!). Initially kept crashing on DX11, but it's been perfectly fine after I switched to Vulkan.",1
When I was int he Goblin camp near the bridge were it appears that a vampire may have attacked a Pig. I was fleeing from the golbmin becuse I needed to save the game a quit when I walked passed the cart on the bridge comming from the Goblin Town i started to bug out on a saving throw check any character that crossed passed the cart when expericnce the same thing. I finally  disinaged from the battle with the Goblins at the gate and was able to save and the glitch stopped. But appeared to happen when I was i,1
