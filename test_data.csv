Awesome game!  It has really rekindled my interest in 5e and the D&D world altogether.,1
Fun single player game or a cool party game with friends.,1
Better than Divinity 2 that is for certain. Congrats to the team. ,1
"Easily one of the best games I've ever played. From story, combat, and replay value. Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece that has an engaging premise and keeps you on the hook as you continue playing. I definitely would love to see them do DLC, as a campaign in the same universe would be pretty fun. That being said, the music was excellent as well as the myriad of options you have in your decision making. 11/10 would adopt owlbears again.",1

"Game so far is amazing, one of the best DnD CRPGs we've gotten.

First lets cover two things:
Basic crashing Fixes - https://youtu.be/72QpsOkOwlE

Save Game Problems - https://youtu.be/B1aI1w5IkrA

Those two vids should help with that stuff.

The actual combat, being turn based is the most enjoyable I've experienced. The game world and narrative is intrigueing. So far the characters are intriguing enough. Its the branching stories and multiple ways to approach and solve problems that makes this game shine.

This game has so much replay value to it its crazy. By far one of the best games ive ever played. Perfect 10,1
"The game is beautiful for early access. There is a lot of depth so far, and Im enjoying the play through. One thing I have noticed were the ability points dont seem to play the same as D&D with the die roll, i.e I have to roll an 8 in persuasion as a Warlock Teifling which gives +2 charisma to the class- so I roll a 6, my +2 to charisma, should be added to that automatically that score or visually shown.
One hilarious glitch, that I think should be left in, is when an NPC/enemy dies, their body stretches an",1
fucking shit game dont play it  much better games out there like Dota,0
"I'd leave a neutral review if I could. The game is a good entry to CRPGs but overall - a pretty bland one. The game is beautiful from both the environment and acting standpoint, whereas the gameplay itself is severely lacking. 

The story is alright but the writing falls short for most of the game. Every single dialogue has basically the exact same options with the exact same outcomes. You run in a lot of dead ends in the game that have literally no reward. The game starts nice but as with all DOS-like lari",0
" When I heard the initial reviews, I was excited to see how it was for myself.  I never played games like this before but always wanted to try it out. The game is well worth the hype and praise it is receiving. I am not familiar with DND at all but I feel like this game really helps get a glimpse at the different components. As someone completely new to the game and playing on a reasonable difficulty I enjoy everything about the game. Hopefully other games/ companies take note to every aspect of this game. ",1
"Very fun! Most of the beta bugs are pretty much gone, only issue i've had is the server crashing but works fine after rebooting. Game play is quality, had plenty of fun playing online. Looking forward to the final release as it will provide so many more hours of play time! Endorsed! Well done team Larian!",1

"Excellent graphics and story line. As this is ""early access"" there's still a lot missing that typical D&D folks will be missing. Combat is good, but sometimes very tough. There's no easy setting for beginners. I'd accept that in exchange for less xp for sure. Also, makes little sense to me why a mob would continue to attack a down player instead of more threatening characters still alive. This needs to change. Death is too easy.

"Fantastic writing, great voice acting, fairly good balancing that makes each class feel important. I played and finished this experience on Tactician after about 300 hours. In order to do so I did have to pay meticulous attention to expendable resources, builds of each character, and some game choices. I found that balance in act 1 felt good, in act 2 I felt like I kept hitting walls where there was a single intended way to get through most encounters.

"Reason I say NO is because the game isn't complete. There are a lot of issues you will run into while playing. For example what I've experience is that during combat you won't be able to move and a few minutes later the game crashes. The game also crashed on me after I load a save file. Those issues has happen to me more than a few times it gets frustrating. Once this becomes a complete game and they fix all the issues, this will be a great game to play.

I'd recommend this game so just roll for it.,1
"Very good update using the the same game-play model as the original Baldur's Gate.
The graphical detail is top notch and character customization is equal to the best of anything out there...when it's completed.
It's hard to gauge how far from complete it is as there are a lot of patchy scenes with missing cinematics, bugged models and all the available playable NPCs are evil or neutral alignment which while entertaining means you can't currently play the game ""paladin style""

"i got this game last saturday. been just over a week, not even fully two. i have put 62 hours into this and i'm not about to stop anytime soon.

this has been SUCH a breath of fresh air for me. i work at a gamestore, selling games that i know will fizzle out. this is a full, 100% completed game upon release, whereas there have been so many that have been half-made, filled with empty promises and microtransactions the moment you open it up. I have been DYING to have a game that has HIT me as hard as this one",1
"There isn't a game, there is a demo.  What is available for play now is really short in terms of video games.  If you were doing this live D&D it would be a much longer period of time, but as for video games and what they have done?  A few hours at most.  In my opinion they shouldn't have even let people pay for this until the game was much further along.  I paid 60 for it basically as soon as one could, and it's been 2 years with only a few classes added but who gives a shit.",0

"This isn't a Baldur's Gate game. This is Divinity: Original Sin 2 wearing the skin of a franchise that I love. I wasted eighty bucks. People talk about how Cyberpunk 2077 was a bait-and-switch, but I was promised Baldur's Gate and, like La Croix is flavoured like someone thought about a fruit near their bottling factories, ""Baldur's Gate 3"" feels like one of Larian's writers dated someone who played Dungeons and Dragons once.

It takes a LOT in 2023 to make a game stand out - BG3 is everything the player base (ever so patiently) waited for since the Studio hyped up the development of the game 04 years ago :D.

All that being said it was clear to me that Act 1 was the most polished. Early Access only gave players access through Act 1 and so you won't find many performance issues or bugs in it.

How many people have paid for this game already, and at quite the price tag I might add, and it still isn't finished?  This one really taught me to stop buying shit before it's finished.  It's clear that they've already gotten my mon",0
"Negatives: Gameplay too slow. Inconsistently punishes small mistakes. Camera angles are counterintuitive and require frequent adjustment using a clunky system. Characters often disappear behind landscape unexpectedly.

Positives: Absolutely gorgeous. Interesting theme and setting.

Overall, the clunky gameplay makes this game boring and frustrating.",0

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an epic adventure that immerses you in a beautifully crafted medieval fantasy world. The graphics are simply stunning, with every pixel carefully designed to transport you to a world of magic, dragons, and adventure. The attention to detail is impressive, from the intricate armor designs to the vibrant, magical landscapes.

The story in Baldur's Gate 3 is equally captivating. You play as a hero who has been transformed into a host for a deadly parasite, and you must travel across the land",1

Getting my ass kicked by goblins never felt better....,1
This game is not even that good its actually crap rolling dice and making your next move is not fun in Baldurs gate 3 and also they should allow you to to remake your character on multiplayer on your friends server if you didn't like your first character I think they could of done better,0
Constantly crashes. Can't get past a certain point in the game because it crashes every time.,0

Particularly the arbitrary zoom limit and inability to move past some walls/cliffs. Luckily this can be fixed by modding, however it should really be in the base game.....

Next is rogue and stealth feeling very incomplete. The enemy sight isn't always accurate, sometimes enemies engage in combat and skip stealth checks even",0

+Your choices matter and they have meaningful impact to the story
+You can go ham on the builds: be as overpowered if you want or stick to a thematic build

"TLDR; DOS:2 is better, don't waste your time.

I really want to recommend DOS:3... i mean BG3, but I just cannot. While this is a good implementation of 5e as a video game, it needs to be said that 5e does not make a very good video game. The rules system in BG3 lacks any customization (common house rules) found in TTRPGs and lacks common features found in all VTT platforms, like turning on/off the dice rolling animations. DOS:2, the game that BG3 shares much of its UI and design assets with, already fixed ",0

I am fully aware that this game is early access but I couldn't even get passed the tutorial without crashes. Did everything other sites recommended to get the game to work but I can't even get it to launch. Definitely not worth paying full price for at the moment.,0
I smeared doodie on my face to infiltrate a goblin camp.,1
"Bad game, poor movement system, too many bugs, bad ending, and bad story",0
"Something I expect when I come into a CRPG is some decent character building options, not the complete tabletop but some. However this game doesn't provide it ala the OG BG, KOTOR or to the most extreme the pathfinder games. Maybe it's the 5e rule set that I don't like but this game doesn't click with me.

A great story, mechanics that feel good to use and, most importantly, none of the annoying BS that most devs are putting into their games these days.

It's not 5e DnD.. and the way they're going I don't think it even will be that close to 5e on launch.

It has shown us that a game can be finished when it comes out. That it can run well, has good graphics, good gameplay and is absolutely worth the price.

great game especially if you liked to play d&d!!!,1
"I really wanted to get into this game. 

The point and click to move, while WASD moved the camera was terrible, If i could swap them, it would have been better.

The other issue i had was it didn't ease you into the move list. Starting out with 13 or so spells/actions was overwhelming. Plus you pick up multiple party members early on which triples the move list.

I will say though that it is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!",0
Premise is cool and im excited to play it but over the 56 hours ive played 50 have probably been waiting on load times. Its very laggy and nothing has been done to fix it. If i am actually able to play the game ill change my recommendation. Update**- The game is amazing! Sadly still plagued by extreme lag. Average FPS is at a 9. Yes 9.,0

The game is amazing however it doesnt let me kiss all the girls at once so i will have to give this game a 0/10,0

Even if the developers fix/finish her later - I've already wasted over a hundred hours on this playthrough and am unlikely to do it again to see the content I actually wanted to see.

"This game is both very good and very amateur.  Note the question was 'would you recommend this', and not 'did you like it'.

They need to address a LOT of things before I'd go around telling people they need to get this.
-The tutorial is almost nonexistent.  Hope 'gaming' means 'looking things up on Google' to you.
-Quest solutions can be ambiguous.  You'll know what to do, but not where to click.  You'll spend enough time looking around that you'll think you've got it wrong, and start looking for other sol",0

But I've been playing some more still cause I want to see if it seems to improve. Maybe it's my own fault but i had really high expectations for this game. It was the followup to the series that made people play CRPGs in the first place, and it's made by the company that made the game that REintroduced people to CRPGS (divinity original sin 2).

"I would have recommended this game. Almost every part of it is well made and fun. The characters move me, the story entertains me. I enjoy how layered the game. There is so much replay value here due to how much reactivity from the environment and NPCs. At first my only complaint was the combat. Whoever designed the combat must worship Loviatar, because it is pain to get through it.

I'm not interested in spending 3+ hours on some battles cause I didn't research it like a school project ahead of time.  Not to mention, why the hell does it sometimes take 10+ mins to 'synch' the cloud save?  Ick.

Truly a phenomenal game. Rich story narrative with potential for countless playthroughs. Every time i play this game i am truly amazed on freedom to make in-game decisions that truly impact the story throughout the course of the story. Many classes and build options for different ways to play the game. Stunning Graphics and probably the best voice acting i have heard (Astarion won me over the first time i met him) This is one of the few games that i believe is worth the full price.,1
"This game has so many little things that make it fun to play. What really appeals to me is that it is reminiscent of Bioware's Dragon Age origins. Interesting story, fleshed out characters, and so many little details that it helps you to immerse yourself into the Forgotten Realms. I haven't even gotten out of Act 1 yet because I just want to find all the little details. 

I also thought I outgrew turn-based combat, but I find myself enjoying it more for the tactical challenge. It forces me to think creative",1

The choices make the game feel infinitely replayable; there is just *so* much to discover and try out.

If you're familiar with D&D 5E, you'll already have an idea of the mechanics, they're fairly faithful and when they aren't it's usually due to reasonable things like game mechanics not really being implementable outside tabletop gaming.

Pro's

- Very immersive locations, nice graphics. Character models look stunning, very detailed. Opening cinematic looks badass. I didn't expect this kind of quality honestly.

- Music is absolutely stunning and beautiful and the same quality as D:OS1 and D:OS2. I already got goosebumps during the charact",1

The graphics are rich and detailed and I really enjoy the feel of open world while still having an excellent main plot and secondary plots. I love the romance options. We have tried both the solo game and the group option and like both. This may be the best game I've played ever, and I'm a player of Elder Scrolls, and both the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series.

Of course, it doesn't look and feel like a Baldur's Gate game, rather, it's Divinity 3 with a 5th edition DnD skin but I can't complain, since the presentation and execution is godlike. There are a few unfortunate modern (insane) society additions like ""body type"" instead of sex, sudden gay romance ambushing you at every turn, the infamous bestiality scene etc. but nothing too glaringly ",1
"I love this game and in my opinion it can 100% be considered a masterpiece, up until act 3. In its current state it's simply not playable. Frame-rates ranging from 40 to an extreme 5 fps on high-end hardware is not what I expect from a released, non-early access product.

But just... everything feels so tedious and combat feels so unsatisfying. It's just RNG RNG RNG. 70% chance to hit? Miss. 3-24 damage? 4 damage, take it or leave it. Anything but a nat 1 will pass this check? Here take a nat 20. Barely tapped? Concentration broken. I understand not everything needs to hit and I have no problem failing skill checks, but it's so obscene",0

On a more serious note, this game lacks any of the charm that Divinity had. I'd rather just play that game instead, since this feels like a watered down D&D 5E with the divinity engine slapped on top.",0

"Well all that waiting ruined the game for me. I think I would rather fill out spreadsheets at work than grind through this game. I get it compared to whats out there is okay, but what a tedious game! 

Making a game overly complex and is for a Civilization game not a CRPG. Don't get me started on the camera, its even worse then DS1 and DS2,

None of the main characters are compelling either visually and personality wise. I am very tempted to just use 3 random hirelings. If the dark hunger character wasn't in the game, I probably wouldn't play it.

"RPG players beware.  Act 3 is full of unintended consequences.  Worse part, the game doesn't warn you so you can loose HOURS of game play if you want to undo one choice in dialog that you wouldn't necessarily realize would have that effect.

Best game since 2009,1
"Was never into DnD but man did this game change my mind. I literally can't think of the right words to describe how freaking amazing this is.

From the story, to the dialogue, to the characters, to the world, to how engaging the game is to how nuts the combat can get.   Like wow.  Also, to add to all that, the game is SUPER smooth and optimized.

"It's with a heavy heart that I must write this review. I sorted DOS and DOS2 with kickstarter and they are 2 of my all time favorite games. I had MAD respect for Larian studios incorporating 4 player local coop in a day and age when money grabbing studios are making players buy 4 copies to play with friends. Me, my wife, 9yr old son and 7yr old daughter loved playing dos2 together on one of split screen, it was amazing. Now in BG3 they stripped 4 player and cut it down to 2 per PC. This is a slippery slope ",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed playing Baldur's Gate 3. I typically only play FPS games and MOBAs but have not really touched on this type of turn-based gameplay. I thought it was very interactive with the dialogue options as well as being able to connect with many different companions or disagree with them. I have discovered only one issue that has been quite annoying which is playing with a Co-Op party of 4 and reaching Act 2, we found gameplay to be very delayed / stuttering. It would take often more than 30 secon",1
"Game of the year?  Nah.  Game of the last decade.  If you're into Larian titles previously you'll be hooked on this, without a doubt.  If you're new to Larian titles, this may have a bit of a learning curve, but nothing too far off the usual CRPG genre.

Your choices DO matter.  Each party member has a set ""code of ethics"" they live by, so your choices can be approved or disapproved of them, which impacts their view of you accordingly.  Honestly, they did great at understanding how the members will vibe wit",1

What a masterpiece Baldur’s Gate 3 is!",1

They've delivered alot for the money. Strong story line, decent characters, good itemisation and customisation and most of all - fun gameplay. 

Its a bit woke for my liking as a conservative bloke. And the sound track just doesnt compare to DOS2 imo. But other than that a great game.",1
"I am truly sorry to say this, because I enjoy the game A LOT and its polished in many ways...

except the endings and last, most important act.

There is so much cut content compared to the early access that I would recommend most of the people to wait until that content is either reintroduced or added as a DLC.

Why?
Because the bugs, characters suddenly reappearing after killing them, companions not making any sense and meaningless endings are killing the whole sense of roleplay.

It's been 3 years since EA dropped. Act 3 could've been a grand final act.

"I had a fantastic time playing this game. It's incredibly enjoyable and immersive. The developers really delved deep into the RPG elements and storyline. One particular boss encounter in the underdark stood out, offering five distinct endings based on prior conversations and the composition of your party. And those are just the endings I've managed to uncover; there could be even more variations. The diverse combat mechanics are also highly commendable.

Nevertheless, there's a notable downside to the game ",0

"I don't think I've ever seen a game with so much forced diversity in my life. It just pulls you out of the game. Even the armies of undead have some type of affirmative action quota. I've never seen anything like this.  It is so obvious the game-makers are inserting modern views into a fantasy world.

"Ultimately, I would recommend the game to people. A lot of people have made pros and cons list so I will skip that and instead give my overall feeling of the game. 

Larian knows how to make an enjoyable game and I feel fans of DOS and DOS2 will enjoy this game as it presents some new twists on things inspired by dnd5e. I look forward to seeing what it will bring once its finally completed. 

The biggest disappointment for me personally is it feels more like DOS3 than BG3. I think this largely comes from La",1
best RPG i played in a long time. Solo experience is awesome... multiplayer needs a bit of polish as it doesn't give you option to kick player character out of the party. if a friend joins and left their character is stuck in the party taking up the slots.

"This game has great promise but just isn't ready to pick up and play yet. Cameras and movement is way too janky. Combat and equipment counterintuitive. 

If they lock the camera behind the selected player and offer drive mode it would be 10x more playable. Save all the janky camera stuff for turn based mode.

There has never been a better looking game with a higher ceiling for a prospect of a final product, but right now trying to play it feels very clumsy and inaccessible to me.",0

Baldur's Gate 3, if it can even be called a game, is a prime example of how not to revive a classic RPG franchise. This disaster of a title manages to disappoint on every level, leaving players wondering how such a travesty was ever allowed to see the light of day.

They sought refuge in a haven so great,
A beverage called ""Baldur's Gate.""

"This game was made by people who are invested in the Forgotten Realms lore.  There are loads of hidden references and callbacks to prior games.  They did an excellent job of adapting D&D 5e rules into a video game, with generally positive changes to spells and abilities to work better in this setting.
However, none of that helps with how repetitive and tedious this game is to play, and the story quickly becomes unengaging after the initial novelty has subsided.  Further, the multiplayer is a shoddy slapped-",0

Fully exploring the world and seeing the decisions  made have an effect.

"Baldur's Gate 3 beckons you like an enigmatic carnival barker, promising a fantastical journey through realms unknown. It's as if your D&D dice have come to life, inviting you to a masquerade ball where dragons waltz and magic sparkles like butt stallion's farts.

The visuals of Baldur's Gate 3 are akin to stepping into a dream, where the canvas of reality is painted by a sorcerer's brush. Every scene is a tapestry woven with exquisite care, from the ethereal forests that beckon you deeper to the nightmaris",1

Its deep storytelling, well-rounded characters, and strategic gameplay make it a must-play for fans of the genre.

"Enjoying the game so far. Positive review because I support how they did their AAA release, but here are my critiques:

DND Mechanics are extremely frustrating, the amount of attacks you will miss will make you want to break your keyboard. There is not much explanation as to what everything means they just kind of assume you are a DND expert which no one in my party was.

Class balance is extremely bad still. Fighter, Barbarian, Sorcerer are all extremely overtuned and everything else seems to be bad. Range",1

preference for a POE or diablo experience but was met with whatever kind of camera / character control this was.

There is no one thing I can point to that makes this game not great.

This isn't even about the game awards (I agree with the decision for other reasons not listed here) I just didn't want to continue to see them asking for a review. This game is so horny it transcends horny and exists in the uncanny valley level of sexualization between regular videogames and porn. There are even certain dialogues where if you don't say no multiple times (because once isn't enough for Larian) they continue to badger you until you say no like 7 times before they stop pressuring you into sex. ,0

Its also worth mentioning that Larian is using a fair business model. No  microtransactions or similar nonsense. You just pay once and get a very big and very good game. Buy it!",1
"TL;DR: XP-starved bug colony.

It looks great, the voice acting, mimics, story, everything is really cool on the surface. But when it comes to the shear number of bugs in this game, it kinda falls apart. NPCs randomly or permanently stopping to follow you around every corner, randomly dying during jumps or fall down ledges, path finding leading your main to vault off buildings, just to name a few. Most of them won't crash your game but at worst they can make it so corrupt, you cannot save the game anymore, ",0

I would recommend waiting until the game is complete and launches sometime in 2023 before you spend your money on this game.

The only reason I own this game is because my wife bought it for me as a surprise x-mas gift. I refuse to pay this much for an early access game. The devs are wrong for not putting this game on sale at times. It's still broke in many ways. They're crooks for making people spend this much on a broke early access game like this. These are the only dev's I have ever seen do this. They're cheap and want people to spend full price on an unfinished game.,0

As a long-time Dungeons and Dragons fan, I had high expectations for Baldur's Gate 3, and I am delighted to say that Larian Studios has delivered an exceptional gaming experience that flawlessly converted the essence of D&D 5th Edition into a state-of-the-art cooperative multiplayer game. From the moment I stepped into the captivating world of Faerûn, I knew I was in for an epic adventure.

One of the standout features of Baldur's Gate 3 is its seamless crossplay functionality, which al",1
"So, I'll admit that I haven't gotten through Act 1, mostly because I can't stomach the game long enough to do so. The disappointment starts at character creation, where instead of having male and female options, they throw everything together in a big mix (body type is not linked to gender is not linked to voice is not linked to genitals). I get that some people like weird stuff, but please make a checkbox in settings for them and make things easier on the rest of us.

Huge fan of BG1 and 2 so naturally I was very excited for BG3.  Sadly it left me very disappointed, the turn-based combat system has ruined it.  I gave myself time to get familiar with it, but no matter how much I play it, it still sucks.  It's just a bad combat system, slow and boring.  The combat feels tedious instead of fun.  It was so fun in BG1/2.

As for the bugs, they range from merely quality-of-life frustrating (party members only show up in camp when you camp in certain areas) to completely game-breaking in Act 3. ",0

If you have a similar mindset like me, you probably know that a review is subjective and ultimatively, you have to decide for yourself if the game is for you. If you think the game is the exact opposite of what I say, it's fine. Both our opinions are completely valuable and true for ourselfes.

* The dice rolling is weird

It's not 1:1 5E rules, but if I consider it Larian's Home Brew rules I really come to love the mechanics that make this game really fun. Want to toss a goblin off the cliff? No problem (As long as you make the appropriate skill check and your character is strong enough to lift the goblin in the first place). Fun game! 10/10.",1

the story so far is engaging and the characters interesting. I am playing on easy mode as the fight mechanics can be a bit overwhelming at first but it becomes clearer the more you play it.
Only negative is that I set my profile to public and got ""invaded"" by another character that I couldn't remove  - check online for this issue - so I had to start again from the beginning. So beware of the multiplay",1

Its one of the best games I have personally played. It gives you the freedom to choose your own path and how you would like to do anything on that path. The amount of interactions are just innumerable, either help someone in need, or just ignore them, or maybe even end them. The same could happen with every camp you find on your way.

"The best feature of Baldur's Gate 3 is that I can skip the intro video on launch and just have a normal (and beautiful!) loading screen on start-up. No mods, no command line edits, just implemented from the get go.

Why is this, something so small in the grand scale of such a game, not a standard across AAA titles? Instead they blast our eardrums out with not even volume control for every following launch after initial setup. Don't tell me this isn't a realistic expectation or standard!

I'm an original Baldur's Gate fan from way back in the 90's and I have to say: this just isn't fun. It's slow. It's tortuously buggy and I simply hate all the characters.

First of all, the game design hinders your ability to enjoy it. For example, let say you want to be a druid. Okay, great. You fight some enemies in wild shape, then you head into town to talk to NPCs or sell things or whatever. Now animal forms cannot speak. ",0

"I sample a lot of media whether it is video games, movies, or music.  I suppose I am a social critic.  I was aware of the development of Baldur's Gate 3 since it came out in early access.  There was suddenly a lot of hype for Balder's Gate on Youtube.  I gave it a try.  

Balder's Gate 3 is not a finished product.  One of the weakness of early access, has been that Early Access titles often don't produce a completed game.  They throw the label of ""Finished Product"" on it, but intend to keep developing it.  ",0

"It is a super duper fun, can't wait to see new content from this game after it's complete release!",1
"By far the best game I've played. Rich story, rich role-play, rich in everything. no game breaking bugs for me, only small annoyances that don't really affect anything. biggest down for me is, that your companions can start conversations including cut scene dialogue and it won't switch to the player character even straight after combat it'll pick whoever is closest and it drives me crazy (not always). I highly recommend giving this game a fair go can't wait to do my power hungry evil play-through.",1

Great game but why can't you pause?,0
"Decided to give this game another shot, but ended up quitting in frustration several more times.  It's still buggy, parts of the story make no sense, and the autosave is basically worthless.  Still regret having paid for this.

-Original review below-

This is very much an unfinished game.  Yes, I know it's early access.  Autosave does not work properly.  If it's worth it to you enough to pay full price for this then go nuts.  I regret it.",0
"Simply put, a masterpiece. Voice acting, plot, pacing, freedom, choices, everything I could touch on is absolutely commendable. The game gives the players all the freedom we could wish for. 2 playthroughs in, I can hardly find anything that is an annoyance.",1
"Its a really cool game. The story is interesting and there are a lot of different ways to solve the adventures and hidden stuff, which I personally enjoy. I like the Dungeons and Dragons Faerun mythology and getting into that world is great. Books are fun. I have been staying up all night and playing. It has been making me look at the clock and be like what? how did that happen?",1

"Looking for game that brings back the joy of Dragon Age Origins? Of being able to role play your character to do whatever you want to do and become whatever you want? This is it.

They've made so many improvements already that it's worth the money now!,1
"Didn't think I would like this, then I saw triple A devs getting butt-hurt over it's outstanding quality and reception, so I had to try it. Immediately fell in love. The only game in my opinion that deserves GOTY in 2023. Its story, mechanics, visuals, voice acting, all of it, are on a level of care and excellence that should be what triple A titles STRIVE to achieve. Despite what their lazy, spoiled, and envious spokespeople tend to believe.",1
"Cool story, got somebody that isn't into DnD into this cool RPG and style game",1
"Pretty freaking good, the game looks great, and I'm not far enough in the story to comment on it but I love the characters so far.",1
"I love playing tabletop D&D and always wished I could involve myself with a lot more D&D combat mechanics/classes, character builds, etc. This game allows me to do that and more. The story is great, player choice in the story is great, graphics are great, combat is incredible, and exploring is very rewarding.

TLDR: Game good 

P.S. Go team Shadowheart",1
This has easily become one of my all time favorite games of all time. So many different ways to play and so many things to do and experience!,1
Love this game! Big corpo dev studios SHOULD be scared of this game!,1

Parts of the Act 3 and especially the ending gave me strong GoT season 8 vibes and I am still trying to recover from my disappointment.

Well i an certainly addicted... bad Larian .. bad!

Jokes aside.
The game is fun, well fleshed out with things to do and discover.

There's somethings i would like to be added, like sliders for characters or ways to actually use ""rope"" or other items you find. But i guess thats a bit too much for a game of such scale, without a true flesh dm OR an OVERLORD AI doing the adjusting in real time.

"The amount of content in this game is insane. I'm not even done the game and I'm already excited for an evil playthrough as the way it will shape the story will be so fun to see.

"Finished up almost all of the content available in act 1 in a duo party with a friend.  As an early access it definitely has some bugs, but overall we had a blast.  I prefer the combat system to DOS2 since you can do things in tandem in a single turn with your team mates (you walk forward, they throw grease where you were, you ignite the grease, etc).  I'm definitely looking forward to acts 2 and 3 whenever they come out.",1
"Early access review: I am utterly smitten with this game. Sunk many, many hours into Early Access and still discovering things that I haven't seen yet.

Wonderful party members and NPCs, and an incredibly interactive world to explore.

Minimal bugs, high quality story and RPG. Larian has outdone themselves. But with Divinity: Original Sin 2, did anyone really have any doubts?

I hope this game proves that putting time and love in your game can make it a huge success. Hopefully other companies will follow Larian's lead.",1

"Thought this game would be more open world. It seems you have to follow the only path made by the game developers and you just have control over your gameplay style.
Not a big fan of the turn-based combat, I try to avoid combat conflicts at all costs because its just frustrating to play.

Right now the main campaign beats are pretty easy to beat in only a few hours but still very fun, even better with a group of friends.

You can never ever create a surprise round attack, since the dialogue pops up after first attack action, and initiative is rolled.

That being said, what i can only assume is a memory leak did get annoying.

But in a lot of ways it feels like Divinity Original Sin 3, and it repeats some of the flaws of that game -- bad camera control, awkward navigation on maps, maps that are too full of stuff and hard to understand, and, generally, the UI is never comfortable. Part of that is I am older and the fonts (and some of the graphical elements) are pretty small.

I bought this game at the second patch then they decided to update the game with new content. It was the worst thing they could've done since no going back is also a bust for me. All the new content doesn't get you any closer to Baldur's gate. The fights are usually hard which makes you think before proceeding.

Easily the best game I've played in a long time. Normally for story driven games I play it once and i'm done with it and I MIGHT go back to mess around with a second.

So fun and a great story. I have played through several ways in the early access and each time is different. Can't wait for the full game.,1

"boring and broke.    Its a ""role play"" game that gives you the attempt at playing as you wish, the level caps make it not worth playing, class's are booring.. the characters are shells.  The story is good however for the price get pathfinder, least its fleshed out.",0

"Half-convinced Larian Studios are just mind-flayers in disguise and this is their attempt at finally realising the Grand Design. Would still sell my soul, 10/10. 

Played through Early Access twice and I was still surprised replaying through Act 1. Then Act 2 hit, and I thought this game couldn't get better. And then Act 3 hit, and I knew I was truly playing a masterpiece. Baldur's Gate 3 is making video gaming history.

The game is really really great. (Yes, really) One thing though before I give more details. I waited on two games this year. BG3 and Cyberpunk 2077. Booth games are wonderful but I really hated the main storyline in 2077 ""There is something in my head I need it gone...."" only to find out that it's exactly the same storyline in BG3. GAH!

"After playing over 400h on the Divinity Games and enjoying very much the BG series, I was really hyped to try out BG3.
RNG in the game felt rigged, characters felt stiff, social interactions a chore, a lot of spells and skills felt underwhelming, quests and exploration didn't feel rewarding.
Still I told myself that it's all due to EA status and wanted to wait for full release to give it another go.
I don't think I will, the long wait just killed the buzz.

"This game consumed my life in the best way. Not only do I enjoy the role playing aspects, but I always thought I hated turned based combat prior to this. By midway through my first playthrough I was playing tactician mode because I love the challenge. 

Another very important aspect to me is just how much the cast and crew clearly poured all of their love into this game. It is clear that it was created in such a safe and loving environment and that they really respected their employees as well as their fans",1
Good game with no micro transactions,1
"Act 3 is garbage.  Act 2 is meh.

It's almost like the Early Access gave extensive playtesting and feedback to Act 1, which is thoroughly fleshed out, but never reached the other Acts.  It's also like Reviews come after people only played Act 1.

Act 1 has things to do everywhere and fully fleshed out variant paths - Barbarian Gnomes kinda stuff.

Act 2 is dingy, dull, buggier (it's all a bit buggy, but it falls off hard), and empty - there's just less stuff everywhere.

Act 3 made me want to start the game",0

The Graphics are majorly fixed .. but we are still getting some issues in the town of Baldurs gate... but thats because of how dense it is and the fact that every NPC reacts to Druids and Minions which causes lag.
Rolls and the required roll to beat have been tuned down from what they used to be. There is also an option that when your cursed ",1

"At its current state, the Early Access is fairly short. While the story and cinematics are breathtaking, the game overall feels like a reskinned DOS2, which is honestly a little disappointing. Maybe a few months from now, when they flesh it out, it'll feel a lot better. I like that they use real D&D 5e dice rolls and mechanics.

Baldur's Gate is the type of game I would always find myself skipping.  Any game that had a screenshot of 15+ icons for attacks and spells displayed on their store page seemed too overwhelming for someone that was used to pointing at something and shooting.

"This game has little to no respect for DnD, IMO.

This game is a sequel to the Baldur's Gate games, but it's a sequel to Dungeons and Dragons games and a successor to a legacy after a fashion that I think it fails to to justice to.

No coup de grace, no readied action, the game plays just like D:OS/2 in too many ways. You can't even say ""Let me wait for the enemy to act"" or ""delay my turn"" which is the easiest thing to implement if you're intransigent about actually implementing the rules that are in 5E.

It's like Firaxis getting the IP to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, and releasing Dawn of War 4 as a 10/10 turn-based XCOM clone with Warhammer 40k 10th edition ruleset. It's excellent, so you enjoy it, but as a longtime fan you also feel like somebody spat in your face",0
"I bought this game with a friend and tried to play multiplayer.  Not sure how solo is, but the battle is unplayable with multiplayer.   Our turns would not match up and we could not continue battle because of this.  Could only play about 1/2 hour into the game before we couldn't proceed because battle was literally unplayable.

I've been playing Larian games since their Divine/Beyond Divinity days and I'm so glad they've grown so much as a developer over the years. I'm so grateful that they have not let themselves be consumed by greed and still do honest good work to develop such tasteful games that are love letters to gamers.

"In general, the game is average, but here's what I didn't like:

1) 12 level is maximum. Cmon, in Patnfinder WotR, all characters can take level 20, and if you are dragon - 40lvl. When you take level 12 in BG, the motivation to play disappears, there is no improvement. Also there are only 12 classes in the game, which is very small.

2) Combat is quite casual. At the maximum level of difficulty it is too easy, there is no challenge in game. In a fight with 1 boss Captain Zhalk, I killed him and his two leve",0

But the gameplay? That's killing me. I like DnD and play regularly but whatever is going on with these dice rolls are insane. It feels like the game will not allow a roll above 10 for skill checks. And heaven forbid you go into a fight, the enemies just won't be hit. I sup",0

It's not the turn based vs continuous time.  It's not 5e vs another edition, as I've played all D&D editions.  The problem is this game doesn't capture the spirit of the Dungeons and Dragons CRPG.

"Played thru the early access for the first half of part 1 and it is, without a doubt, amazing.  Stopped playing because I wanted to experience the final release relatively spoiler free.",1
Amongst all the rave reviews be wary that act 3 is the typical Larian Studios final act disaster at launch- Only 6% of players have finished the game which undoubtedly accounts for the positive outpouring since the game progressively becomes less polished and culminates very sloppily. Like with Divinity 2 needing updates for the final act I am sure they will fix this game too with an enhanced edition or a similar equivalent but until then it is a far cry from what the hype might have you believe.,0

I must say the main story in this game is intriguing for someone that is new to DnD. 100% should be game of the year but this is a game that requires players to take their time and appreciate everything that is in store for them.

You shouldn't have to cheeze the game to pass all the combat encounters.  If you approach it like D&D you will have a very hard time.  Which takes most of the fun out of it for me.

Do not buy this game.  Larian put it up for sale as early access way before they should have.  It has been 2 years and the game is still nowhere near to being playable as a complete game.  They predict late 2023 for final release but it is very doubtful they will even make that target.  Wait for the full release before considering a purchase.

I don't understand how this game is getting so many positive reviews. How can a single player game gets laggy so much? It has too many bugs that make it very annoying to play.

Baldur's Gate 3 is an amazing game if you like story pacing, DnD and beautiul graphics. I also changed my mind about the  combat system. While Divinity 2's system was faster and you had more possibilites to encounter the battle, Baldur's Gate 3 let's the play think more about their actions. In my opinion the game focu",1

As a CRPG player who began with Ultima's in the 80's and played pretty much every CRPG since, I have some experience in this genre.

Act 1 is amazing 10/10, act 2 starts to show some minor problems 9/10, but act 3 my god. Act 3 is a disaster in almost every way.

"It's bad when games like Elden Ring and Street Fighter have better character customization than a literal Dungeons and Dragon's game, where you should be able to feel like you can make anything you want. Oddly limited for what it claims to be.
None of the characters you meet are likable, at least to me they weren't. It seems like everyone is just annoying. The plot isn't very captivating, either. If this game was meant to feel like the old Baldurs Gate games (or, akin to a Bioware styled RPG) then they fail",0

With heightened expectations it would have been easy to peck at the game's flaws and suffer a modicum of disappointment. The truth is I'm blown away by nearly every aspect of the game, from the visuals to the dialog to the systems.

And by no means is this Divinity the only things it shares in the inventory screen, turn base. So lets make this the best game of 2020 and give them good constructive feedback.",1
Is a good game,1
While there is no doubt that this game is beautiful and a masterpiece in the making. In it's current state I found it very unplayable even for an early game. The game was super unstable and the first thing my character did when it loaded in was T-pose. Which is never a good sign. I will give it another try once the game is a bit more stable. For now I want my money back. There are plenty of other amazing titles on the market right now. 63 USD is just way to much for something that is this buggy and unstable,0

Fun game but after reaching Act 3 the game has gotten progressively worse in terms of options in the story and bugs found.

Commendable pro-customer scope

I am very glad everyone else loves this game, I can not. 
It has a lot of going for it, and I appreciate it for a lot of what it is.
Here are the bad parts, post first play-through:

To be honest, the game is way too unforgiving and feels like a constant punishment or an exercise, not a relaxing experience.

Be able to relax from a stressful day/week at work without being pushed/prodded/manipulated into battlepass or gotcha systems or an otherwise incomplete, frustrating experience that is trying to milk you for more.

I've played co-op about 4 times now, each about 6-10 hours and half of every session was spend troubleshooting, restarting, and reloading.

the game in combat doesn't function like you'd expect it to. Pathing is jank as hell, your character will waste entire turns and actions",0

If you love RPGs like Neverwinter Nights, the old Baldur's Gate games or Divinity you have to give this game a try.",1
"Too many bugs, and more frustrating than fun.

Example of a bug: there was a pedestal where I needed to place an object in my inventory. Stand next to the pedestal and use the Drop command? Object drops to my feet (and becomes a pixel hunt to find). Stand on the pedestal and drop it? Object drops 5-10 feet away in a random direction (and often lands in a place where the game won't let me retrieve it, like the outer sill of an open window). Throw it onto the pedestal? It rockets back at me and does damage.

"I just finished playing Baldur's Gate 3, and what an exhilarating journey it has been! The game's captivating visuals, coupled with an enthralling narrative and a wealth of intricate lore, truly make it a masterpiece.

While my review might lean heavily toward effusive praise, it's important to address the game's evident shortcomings. These include problematic triggers with",1

"The blood, sweat, and tears the developer put into this game are obvious in every moment of it.

There are no filler encounters, there are no fetch quests, and there is no black-and-white morality. There is only an encapsulating story that will keep you playing for longer than you think and keep you remembering those memories for years to come.

There isn't much quite like it out there. This game is a masterpiece.",1
"I played a lot of this game and will probably keep playing it off and on but I just can't recommend it. If I could go back and stop myself from buying it I would.

It's by no means a bad game and you'll probably have a lot of fun with it, but it just doesn't do it for me. For context I've finished Act 2 (of 3) on one character but I just don't have the motivation to continue. I've tried different characters and runs and those don't even make it past Act 1. Over 50% of my playtime is making those characters.",0

I can't recommend this game enough. If you are tired of the rat race of the gaming scene now this is a totally refreshing change to see of a game releasing complete.

"+Great Combat
+Amazing storytelling
+Visuals are outstanding

-Would like an option to reduce vfx as there are times, especially in big battles, where the game stutters due to the sheer amount of stuff going on. Even on low settings
-A preview of the skills and talents for each class would go a long way into planning builds

Overall a great game and likely GOTY. There are places where improvements can be made but what game doesn't? Interested to see what the general QoL updates bring",1

"Acts 1 and 2 are great. I was actively engaged until Act 3. In Act 3 the game becomes a sub par RPG where quests are scattered with no sense of urgency. I do like the game but Act 3 ruined the sequence/pacing of the story line. The story reminds me of Game of Thrones where there is a lot going on but the directors just wanted to conclude the series. So they had to throw in a bunch of conclusions in single setting so that the audience could feel that every story line mattered. 
I knew Act 3 was rushed so bad",0
"The DnD players may enjoy, but I tire of hour long fights, group wipes from full health because every attack on the zombie-flayer-mushroom-etc. missed. The three critical failures in a row also killed my enjoyment.

"I had an elaborate review for EA but after full release, I'll say something I never thought I'd ever say: the AAA devs were right - this game collapses under its own scope and it's not a pretty sight.

BG3 has budget and great maps and... that's it. This game has been nothing but disappointment after disappointment for me. Idiotically escapist, bland, creatively bankrupt, doesn't know what it wants to do with its mechanics, obviously rushed... It's like witnessing the wings of Icarus burn as he nears the Su",0

Obviously still early access but a lot of fun. I love the changes to the 5e rules to tweak it to be better for this format but still feeling extremely faithful. I do want more none combat spells but I'm sure that will come with more development of the other spellcasting classes. I'm not a fan of how the long rest mechanic works with the camp and just teleporting to it.

Overyhyped and under-delivers considering that it has been in Early Access for 3 years and still has problems, bugs, weird character development.

Would not recommend this game to anyone.  Horribly written and poor mechanics. Lackluster game play.  No replayability.  In fact I struggle to repeat Act 1 from early access.  Can barley play more than an hour until totally bored and log out.,0
"This game is a rollercoaster, I feel like I'm in a fever dream and I can't stop playing. It's so good though the start is a little confusing/overwhelming but the game just clicks when you reach the first town (which is early).

"This game was in early access for 3 years, so why are the mechanics to move the party such garbage? Almost every cRPG in the past 25 years has had the ability to set a specific order for the party, and it would adjust and work with whichever character you were moving at the time.

SOMEHOW this was missed by Larian over the course of 6 years, half of that in early access, when a quick look at Reddit confirms that people playing in Early Access specifically requested this feature and were ignored?

this has the potential to be outstanding but I advise you to consider this is a pre release and you are really limited in what you can do and how far you can progress the game as of 10/17/20 caps at level 4 which in D&D is just about the 1st level you really get to experience the specialization benifits to your character and there really isnt much to do after that. When this game is in it's final form it has the potential to be one of the greats. So if you have patience check it out now if you dont wait.,1

A great gateway drug to DnD 5e. The innumerable options at your disposal is fantastic. Play the game your way and lose hours of you life. I cannot stress how well the acting and VA's are.

"This is NOT a Baldur's Gate game. Larian obtained the rights and turned BG into a reskinned DoS with BG assets. If you are a fan of BG this is not for you. You cannot roll for stats, its all fixed with bonuses from race. You can't even change it from turned based mode. BG games were ALWAYS real time combat with the ability to pause.",0

Here are some examples, pre-release the game had difficulty with inventory management, particularly through the numerous keys, potions and camp supplies throughout the game resulting in lots of clutter. So Larian does what Larian does best an",1

Yes my computer is well over specs, installed latest drivers and windows updates, no overlay or other applications, installed on a solid state drive.

After 140 hours I finally completed my first play-through... and probably at 20 hours in I was already thinking about how much I wanted to replay it.

Baldur's Gate 2 is one of my TOP 3 games of all times so believe me I was very excited about this game. I preordered it before early access but I did not want to play it until it comes out being afraid of bugs and the lack of content. Even after the launch I was waiting more than a month to start playing it cause I was still expecting some technical difficulties. Now that I'm actively playing this game I have to say that I love the concept to the moon and back but the bugs and glitches are making this game ,0
"I like the concept, characters and story but the game is so buggy! UI vanishes, when doing dialogue options characters not in your party show up anyway, after doing a skill check the game goes into an endless loop and forces to restart or go to an older save making you lose hours of progress. Maybe when the bugs get fixed it'll become playable but until then I'm not a fan",0

Having some technical troubles but confident that they'll be ironed out. Loving every minute of it so far!,1

Geoff Keighley ignored this game as indie for Game Awards. But this is the best indie in the history and a good sample how to create games. For all. For both indie developers and corporate rats.,1
"Despite still being in early access it's got a LOT of replayability. Each class and race has clearly had a lot of thought  put into them and offer a different gameplay experience- definitely keen to see what others are added during game development!
Plus a fun story too :)",1

When I try to run this game I get an account creation screen for Larian shoved in my face and I can't get past it without creating an account.  The window is also the wrong resolution and I can't close or resize it.  What happened to buying a game and just being able to run it without signing up for garbage you don't want. This resizing problem has been reported since February on the discussion page.  BIG THUMBS DOWN ON THIS!!!,0
good game want to bang karlach so bad she is my mommy,1
Incredible game. lives up to the hype. Mechanics like the real 5e D&D ttrpg so that might no be for everyone but its a blast as an crpg format. great characters and writing too. hard to put it down.,1
A lot of fun to just play around getting used to the mechanics and how classes work.  Can't waif for the full game to come out.,1

Larian Studios did not care to polish the last half of the game the same way they did with the first...

"This game ruined RPGs for me. Now whenever I play another RPG it just doesn't measure up to what Larian has created here. I'm a fan of D&D but I normally steer clear of turn based games when it comes to video games. The combat actually turned out to be pretty fun but not Xcom2 levels of fun. No... honestly the combat could have been terrible and I would still recommend this game. The story and voice acting is top notch.

Has this game the potential to be good. Absolutely. Is this a good game? No. I am waiting for an eternity for it to BECOME a game and not just an Act 1 that makes me angry because i have to wait. The industry development to let players pay full price to be the dev's guinea pig is disgusting and this game is one of the worst offenders i have seen so far.

While definitely a step in the right direction for triple a as a whole, and how impressive how deep and detailed the game is, I did not really enjoy my time here.

Just because a game isn't full of micro-transactions, doesn't make it great. Also the game feels unfinished, and rushed in act 3. The characters are all horny as hell, Lae zel will wan't to f*** your character after 2 minutes of talking to her. Even the Mind flayer Emperor who's technically soulless wants to fuck your character.  Definitely the most med",0
Awesome game for anyone who's into D&D or wants to get into it!,1
This is the most amazing game I have played in decades sans LOZ. I have never left a public review before but this game absolutely warrants it,1
Some of the content towards the end of act 1/beginning of act 2 is just so good. It's worth the price of admission alone. Hopefully I can play slow enough for major issues with acts 2 and 3 to get ironed out before I arrive.,1
"I was worried based on the early gameplay videos that this would play identical to the other Divinity games. Well, it does. There are so many reused assets, its criminal. Bugs, bugs, bugs.

This just FEELS like a cash grab to me. Will need to refund.",0
"I'd like to start off this review by saying this game isn’t bad per se, however it does not reflect the overwhelmingly positive reviews I've been seeing all over the place. Overall I'd give it a 5 or 6 out of 10.




[h1]Classes aren't properly balanced[/h1]

Spell casters start out very strong early to mid game, and melee users usually end up dying frequently in act 1 until they multiclass in my experience, however in act 3 melee completely surpasses magic in most aspects doing more damage and having more ",0

"I've heard so many good things about this game, so I figured I would check it out.  Ran into a bug where one of my companions, Gale, had a necrotic aura that constantly killed everyone in my party, right at the beginning of the game.  This was on the easiest difficulty.  Combined with the tedious inventory management and frustrating turn-based combat, I've decided that I would rather watch paint dry.  Which is a shame because this looks like one of the best RPGs out there in terms of choice and consequence.",0

"It's only in early access and I already got my 1hr/$ from this game and this is just the first act of it. There is so much replayability in this game. I highly recommend it solely based off the single player. Of note, I am a big 5E D&D fan and this game is a great execution of that rule set. If you are not that familiar with 5E it might not shine as brightly for you as it did for me, but I really enjoy this game and I hope you give it a chance!",1
I think it's pretty good.,1
Really nice on the good support.,1
"And I thought Divinity 2 was buggy. I'm sure it's a lot better in single-player, but our coop experience was pretty bad (although really funny).
The highlight of the night was when I (paladin) joined a combat my party member got himself into. He killed two tieflings and that counted as breaking my oath.
At night, we rested, and him (playing Astarion) woke up to suck some blood. Instead of Gale, the Oathbreaker Knight replaced him in the cutscene and so he drank his blood till the knight died. Then just woke",0

I was overly enthusiastic to see a new Baldur's Gate game was hitting the streets.  I have been nothing but disappointed.  The interface is terrible and not intuitive and you are saddled with a party full of a-holes and whiners that undo all the enjoyable parts of the game.  A good DnD based game is about fighting hard and exploring dungeons to slowly build your party into a more capable version of itself so you can confront greater challenges.

"There's some things wrong with Baldur's Gate 3.

Let's start with starting the game.

First, I start the Steam client. Cardinal sin, in my opinion, #1 for anything that results from a user interaction is not acknowledging that an interaction occured at the very first opportunity.
I mean, this was hammered into me in fucking 1994. The Steam client takes 9 seconds until it shows the very first splash screen - until then, I get no indication whatsoever that my interaction was received.
Ok, that's not any fault",0
"Had a blast playing through this, Larian did an excellent job capturing the Baldur's Gate feel from the previous two games and overall made a damn good game that's pretty faithful to D&D mechanics.

While the game was excellent, a few things bugged me:

- The max level cap being 12. This felt a bit silly since 1/4 of the way through the last act, I was max level and yet still earning XP from kills/quests/etc that was going to nothing. You could get up to level 20 in BG2 but idk, maybe Larian will add an exp",1
"Multiplayer literally does not work half of the time you are playing. Cutscenes will desync, combat will start for only some players, and a whole plethora of other bugs.

"Came back for the nostalgia and was very disappointed. I think their approach to make it like Dnd gameplay was interesting, but it was simply awful. Maybe when the game is fully released (out of early access) it will be better, but until then I'm just glad I was able to get a refund.",0
Frustrating.,0

"I wish I could choose neutral with the review. The game play is good in my opinion however I've restarted many times to try and get the right feel so to speak. . My biggest issue is the fact that there are so few companions to choose from.  Roughly half of previous Baldurs Gate games. You can also only create one custom character. They do have hirelings you can get after 3rd level but you are unable to customize any race or appearance on them.

Game of the decade. True D&D feel. Highly recommended to all RPG players,1
Super fun and definitly worth every penny,1
"What Larian has accomplished is nothing short of what a D&D game should be, fantastical and fun. I played 90 hours during EA and have put in the same amount after release. The love and passion put into the game shows with all the wild and crazy options unlocked from even the smallest choices. I know people that won’t play TTRPGs but get to enjoy the same whimsical feel now through Baldur’s Gate 3.

"The game is unfinished at the moment. Its current state is already quite enjoyable, but if you were like me who cares about gear progression, then better wait for 2 or 3 months to see if Larian can fix it.

The problem so far that makes the game feel unfinished:

Fun to play and, and unlike so many games that claim to be DnD style, this really is. Although it's still alpha and the total RPG experience has not yet been completely finished, it is still engaging. Glad the 20 year wait produced such quality. BG fans can rejoice in the knowledge that BG3 was definitely worth the wait. Hope there is a 4 or an extension leading further into the r",1

"Judging by the vast amount of simpery for this game, we're gonna need a negative review, because this game is FAR from perfect, and some of the oversights are just plain embarrassing. Let's do this.

- AI pathing in BG3 is the worst I've ever seen in any game - even Mass Effect did a better job. AI party members will go almost immediately face first into harmful terrain if you're not manually directing them. Then, sometimes you'll walk into a fight only to realize a party member got stuck somewhere a half m",0
"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:

I'm not severely disappointed with the game but at the moment I can't say it's a $60 item. I'm sure it will come to be a good game in the future after it has made it through full release. But at the moment I would advise waiting unless your excitement is so palpable you have to gets your hands on the game rough edges be damned.

After playing for a few hours (16.8 at time of commenting) I who have never played a DND game and barely gotten into Divinity Original Sin 2 can wholeheartedly say this game is amazing. Its hard but not unfair at times. There is always a way to get around something or get past something difficult. It took me like 3 days to figure out an efficient way to kill one of the goblin bosses (because I suck) but once I found out a cheese strat I blew him the f up. This game is amazing and I cant recommend it enough.,1

Still, despite all of the good points, it's still an Early Access meaning you only have a part of the game available, and who knows when it finally releases (postponed a couple of times).

"Larian studios has been developing role-playing games for about two decades now. They developed all the games in the Divinity series, most recently Divinity: Original Sin II Definitive Edition. That game alone is one of the best recent party based role-playing games and is very much responsible for revival of isometric RPGs.  They fancy themselves an indie studio, and while technically correct, charge a AAA price for what is essentially an early access indie game.

This game is made of pure love with the mindset of the old fashioned game dev. Make a game that is polished and does not yearn to steal money from our players by drip feeding content at release. 70 of my current hours were spent in the early builds of the game in Act 1 spanning across 2020-to early 2023 so i already knew most of what i was going to do. I sort of speed ran through all the stuff i had done in prior years so i perhaps spent about 20 hours in it however when i got to act 2 my game time got ALOT,1

Almost all the characters are engaging, the narrative of the story is cohesive and you just feel the impact of your choices, and the choices actually matter in this game as there are several potential endings.

"This game is incredibly content rich, has an engaging story and interesting characters, solid mechanics and interface and overall is a joy to play, highly recommended.

But it's so buggy it's actually mind-boggling that they released it like this. They obviously didn't test a large portion of it, and I mean most of it. After Act I, you will experience a game that gets more and more buggy and choppy as you play. Every ten minutes, it gets worse, every quest, it becomes more broken. I've had games brick my entire save file- and I mean all 20+ saves ",0
Wack.,0
"Fantastic storytelling, as well as a great facsimile for actual tabletop D&D. Lovingly crafted as an emulation of the pen & paper experience, and optimized in all the ways you would hope when transported to the digital space.

The voice-acting, writing, and acting are all  on point and if you love the Divinity games, this could very well seem like the best iteration of those combat systems as Larian now has license (literally) to embrace their systemic roots.

It's legit.,1
"Can't recommend this to anyone who's trying to buy a sequel or spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate duology. The liberal reinterpretation of the ruleset and the focus on environmental hazards makes this unrecognizable to anyone who's played even a single D&D 5E module.

Yes, to be fair, it's an early access game and we all knew it would only have one act. But at this point in time, act 1 is not finished either. The game is a buggy mess, almost as if Larian did very limited bug fixing before releasing their fully priced early access game.

"Obviously its early access so it's buggy, as  anyone would expect.  The problems here are much more fundamental.   Larian has entirely failed to capture the spirit or the essence of BG franchise.  The companions are one note and boring,  It's impossible to know where they ultimately intend this to land, but the basic premise of the story arc lacks creativity.   I have only spent 8 hours with it, but so far it completely lacks the  addictive quality and creativity that made BG1 and BG2 classics.  The visuals",0

"Baldurs Gate 3 is fundamentally one of the best video games to come out not only this year but also in recent years. The game itself to speak only of the gameplay is a brilliant blend of DnD and Larian's gameplay formula and delivers on the gameplay department in every aspect.

"tldr:  Rated 6/10.

Steam only allows yes/no on recommendation, but if you enjoyed Larian's previous games, Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2, you will enjoy Baldur's Gate 3.  There are many upgrades.  However, if you found D:OS mechanics and overall design annoying - and I do - you will be annoyed here as well.

I've seen some glowing reviews of the Early Access, so I bought the game in July 2023, just a few weeks before release.  I've only played with early access patch 9.  There are changes with the final r",0

The gameplay is quite nice, however the music is terribly unfitting to the environment and to the game as a whole (Baldur's Gate 1 music was amazing comparing to this crap). Also it is worth mentioning that this game could win the award for the most unintuitive camera operation and placement in all the games so far (ok, maybe except the first Tomb Raider)",0

"I wanted to like this game, I really really did, but I am a gameplay first kind of person and this simply does not deliver.

Pros:
-Story: The story is pretty interesting. Nothing to write home about but I also didn't get that far into it.
-Freedom: You have varied choices in how you approach situations or respond to npcs in dialogue. There are a good amount of dialogue choices and they have an impact on how the conversation goes, plus there are extra choices for your class and race lots of the time. The ga",0

Identical engine, combat, characters, UI, skill system... about the only thing missing from DOS2 is that terrible armor system they had for combat.

"This game is yet another recent example of a hype train gone wildly out of control. I've been playing D&D and Pathfinder for over 20 years and was totally unimpressed. This game essentially takes people who have possibly never rolled a dice before, gives them NO explanation of one single D&D rule or game mechanic, and then shoves them into a campaign run by the most sadistic DM you've ever suffered under. The entire game is working against the player. I cannot recommend this game at this time.",0

"This is the most fun I've had with a game since my first playthrough of Skyrim almost a decade ago. I didn't think I could get into the turn based mechanics of combat, but I actually find it really easy to keep track of all my characters and what we can do. There are a few bugs, especially in the last act, but overall this is one of the best games in my library.

And I got to date a vampire in it.",1

"I knew I would enjoy this game since I'm a big D&D fanatic. It has a rich story which really doesn't start till Act 2 but the game keeps you involved whether it be through the main story or through the side quests. The characters have interesting story lines, some which you can complete without the character. The character growth in them is insane. This game gets my vote for GOTY.",1

[h2]The testing could have been done better[/h2]
I played the game in its early development stages. I was first apprehensive since I was concerned about a game being created during the Covid Pandemic, and all games launched at the time were flops because no studio could really do things remotely well.

The game itself has numerous faults. Black screens, terrible multiplayer party locking, and a slew of sequence-breaking bug",0
"I've bought this game for 4 other people and will continue to buy it for others. Not only is this game absolutely beautiful and wonderfully fun, but it's also packed with so much story, detail, and replay-ability that I can see myself easily putting over 500 hours into this. I love the options for multiplayer, incredible character design, and don't get me started on the talented voice acting.
We should all support Larian Studios for putting out a highly polished, finished game with no micro-transactions.

Let me preface that I am not a fan of RPGs at all. I am an avid DnD player and this is what I have wanted for years! A game that I can play and get the same experiences as if you were around a table with your friends. This game has given all of us so many laughs and has been the only game that has kept my attention longer than a few hours this year! If you love Dnd you are gonna love this game. I hope this game changes how games are gonna become in the next years!,1
"The gameplay in Baldur's Gate 3 is nothing short of impeccable, and the world is captivating. This feels like a game made out of love for the craft, not just for profit. It offers an open-ended experience where anything can happen. As a fan of Dragon Age: Origins, this game achieves what its sequels couldn't. It's possibly the best RPG of the decade and one of the greatest video games I've ever played.",1

Get it for the multiplayer shenanigans and mods maybe?,0

The graphics are good, but not good enough to overcome the limited game play or poorly understood/followed D&D ruleset. I suggest NOT giving them your money before they finish, as they seem to think the model of early release to bring in cash to poorly managed game projects is the way to go.",0

"There sincerely are fewer games I'd recommend more highly than Baldur's Gate 3. Fantastic graphics, animations, and voice acting makes for a beautiful and stunning experience, but the real meat to this game is the incredible gameplay. There's an amazing level of depth and breadth to the world that's available to the player to explore, and many, MANY ways to explore it. Plenty of interactions in and out of combat facilitate you to handle any situation exactly as you'd like to handle it, whether you'd like to",1

"The game itself is not bad. 

What makes it unplayable is the same culprit that makes all of these games unplayable: Dungeons and Dragons is the single worst system ever devised for RP, and there exist hundreds of gamelines with mechanics that do not require you to endlessly navigate a maze of ""choices"" that either make no difference or, AT BEST, perhaps make a difference you can't spot.

It continues the legacy of Divinity: Original Sin 1 & 2 and Baldur's Gate, merging the two together almost seamlessly. However, the merger also brings with it a few hangovers and at times the game can feel more like another Divinity: Original Sin than an all-out D&D experience.

Story is good, albeit slightly cliche, characters are decently likeable, there's plenty of different paths, gamestyles, classes and such to try and experiment and something we haven't seen in Larian game at all.
